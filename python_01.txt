1. Whetting your apetite

if you do much work on computers, eventually you find that there's some task you'd to automate. For examples,
you may wish to perform a search and replace over a large number of text files, or rename and rearrange a
bunch of photo files in a complicated way. Perhaps you'd like to write a small custom database, or a specialized
GUI application, or a simple game.

If you're a profesional software developer, you may have to work with several C/C++/Java libraries but find the
usual write/compile/test/re-compile cycle is too slow. Perhaps you're writing a test suite for such a library and
find writing the testing code a tedious task.
