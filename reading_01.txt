Hello, everthone! Welcome to English Avenue,
where English becomes exciting!

Today, you're not just watching a video 
you're stepping into a new reality.

If you listen carefully, this could be the
moment that changes your life forever.

I'm here to tell you something that
no one else will tell you,

something that could ingnite a fire 
in your soul.

Let me ask you a question:
are you happy with your life right now?

if you died tomorrow, would you be
proud of what you've achieved?

if your answer is no, then this is your
make-up call. Because let me tell you,
your life isn't going to change by accident.

It's not going to improve by luck.
The life you want will only come 
when you decide to change it.

Stop living in excuses: You've beeen
making excuses for too long.

I'm too young. I'm too old.
I don't have money.
I don't have time.
