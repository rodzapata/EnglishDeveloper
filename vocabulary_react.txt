00:00:00,199 --> 00:00:05,120
hey guys welcome to my 2024 react crash

2
00:00:02,919 --> 00:00:07,279
course so this is something I do every

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:09,160
two to three years not just with react

4
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:11,799
but all the big Frameworks just to kind

5
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:13,920
of keep up to date so this course is

6
00:00:11,799 --> 00:00:16,359
designed to get you up and running with

7
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:18,560
react as quickly as possible and this is

8
00:00:16,359 --> 00:00:20,600
geared toward beginners so if you've

9
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:23,240
never used react before you're in the

10
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:25,720
right place and we're going to build a

11
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:27,679
front end for a joob listing website and

12
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:30,960
you'll be introduced to Concepts like

13
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:34,399
components props state hooks data

14
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:36,879
fetching and much more and we'll also be

15
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:39,520
using the react router to create a mult

16
00:00:36,879 --> 00:00:40,879
uh multi-page application also in the

17
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:44,039
real world you you're going to be

18
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:45,760
working with backend data and apis so

19
00:00:44,039 --> 00:00:48,879
we're going to use the Json server

20
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:51,160
library to create a mock rest API as our

21
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:53,480
back end now one thing I want to mention

22
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:55,559
real quick is that react 19 is right

23
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:57,920
around the corner and it does add some

24
00:00:55,559 --> 00:01:00,640
new features many of those features are

25
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:02,559
under the hood meaning that the concepts

26
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,879
of react when it comes to writing the

27
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:06,439
code and the fundamentals those aren't

28
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:09,080
going to change as far as what we're

29
00:01:06,439 --> 00:01:11,080
doing here so the biggest change to

30
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:13,439
react 19 is that they're adding a

31
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:15,479
compiler which will convert react code

32
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:18,159
into regular JavaScript potentially

33
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:21,759
doubling performance so it'll work in a

34
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:23,720
similar way to uh Frameworks like spelt

35
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:26,720
now we're going to be using version 18

36
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:28,400
in this video as 19 isn't released yet

37
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:30,280
but all the Core Concepts that we're

38
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:33,200
going to talk about are the same so it

39
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:35,640
doesn't matter if you're using 18 or 19

40
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:37,320
and I did do a video on react 19 a

41
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:39,520
couple weeks ago and we used the

42
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:41,479
experimental version of react to test

43
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:43,000
out some of the new features so that

44
00:01:41,479 --> 00:01:45,439
might be something that you want to

45
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,719
watch after this if you're interested

46
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:48,759
all right so we're going to take a look

47
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:51,799
at some slides and then we'll get right

48
00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:51,799
into learning

49
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:59,320
react okay so like I said we're going to

50
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:00,840
spend a little bit of time with some

51
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:03,000
slides just to kind of give you an

52
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:04,960
overview of what react is and what it

53
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,759
entails and I'm going to warn you that

54
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:09,679
it may be overwhelming if this is your

55
00:02:06,759 --> 00:02:12,160
first introduction to the library and

56
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:14,360
that's why I like to to be more Hands-On

57
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:16,360
and jump right in but it can be helpful

58
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:18,519
to have an overview just so you

59
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:21,280
understand what react actually is in

60
00:02:18,519 --> 00:02:24,040
some of the terms that we'll be using so

61
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:26,400
what is react it's a JavaScript library

62
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:28,440
for building user interfaces and it

63
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:31,519
allows us to build user interfaces and

64
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:33,480
front ends of websites and applications

65
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:36,400
using components which I'll talk about

66
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:38,360
soon and it's maintained it was created

67
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,599
and maintained by Facebook and a

68
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:43,239
community of individual developers and

69
00:02:40,599 --> 00:02:45,599
companies you probably have heard react

70
00:02:43,239 --> 00:02:47,720
referred to as a framework I refer it to

71
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:51,040
it as a framework all the time but it's

72
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:52,680
actually uh a UI library to be specific

73
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:55,159
and the difference is that a framework

74
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:57,519
is a complete solution so angular for

75
00:02:55,159 --> 00:03:00,040
instance is a full-featured framework

76
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:02,599
because it includes a router an http

77
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:06,080
client aate management library and much

78
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:08,040
more and the reason that react is often

79
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:10,440
referred to as a framework is because it

80
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:13,400
operates like one and it's in direct

81
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:15,799
competition with Frameworks like angular

82
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:17,640
so and in fact it's actually the most

83
00:03:15,799 --> 00:03:19,840
popular out of the major front-end

84
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:23,080
Frameworks which are react vue.js

85
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:25,599
angular and spelt and it's often used

86
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:28,360
with other librar such as react router

87
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:31,239
to create a full featured solution and

88
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:33,239
also the ecosystem of react is huge so

89
00:03:31,239 --> 00:03:35,720
it can be used for a wide variety of

90
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:38,000
applications such as single page apps

91
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:40,319
serers side rendered applications and

92
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,159
static websites which I'll talk I'll

93
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:46,200
talk more about those in a few minutes

94
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:48,200
as well all right so why react now back

95
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:50,239
in the day the web was very static you

96
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:52,079
would click on a link and it would take

97
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:54,280
you to another page the entire page

98
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:57,480
would refresh this was the state of the

99
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:59,360
web for a long time then came along Ajax

100
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:01,799
and this allowed us to make requests to

101
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:04,239
the server and get data without having

102
00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:07,280
to refresh the page and this was kind of

103
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:09,599
a game Cher in terms of of the user

104
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,560
interfaces so it allowed us to build

105
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:15,879
single page applications where we can

106
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:17,959
have a very Dynamic user experience but

107
00:04:15,879 --> 00:04:20,799
as this type of application and

108
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:23,759
interface grows it can become very hard

109
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:26,680
to maintain and this is where react and

110
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:29,039
front-end Frameworks come in um we can

111
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:31,240
build dynamic uis in a way that's easy

112
00:04:29,039 --> 00:04:33,320
to maintain and scale and if you've ever

113
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:35,440
tried to build a large scale UI with

114
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:37,280
vanilla JavaScript you know that it's

115
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:40,080
quite a task and the code gets very

116
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:41,919
unorganized and messy unless you you

117
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:44,160
build your own framework or something

118
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:46,680
like that so react and and these other

119
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:49,320
Frameworks make this much easier now

120
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:52,000
traditionally just to talk about how it

121
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:54,360
works kind of under the hood react used

122
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,360
something called the virtual Dom the Dom

123
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:58,199
meaning the document object model which

124
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:59,800
you should be familiar with if you're

125
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:02,160
not I would definitely recommend

126
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:04,120
learning more vanilla JavaScript first

127
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:06,479
but the virtual Dom is a lightweight

128
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:08,960
copy of the actual Dom and when the

129
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:11,199
state of a component changes the virtual

130
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:13,520
Dom changes first and then react will

131
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:16,120
compare the two the virtual Dom and the

132
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:18,080
actual Dom and it will update the parts

133
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:20,000
that need to be updated so this is

134
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:22,479
traditionally how react works that's how

135
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,840
version 18 works that we're using now

136
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:27,479
and every version before it however with

137
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:29,759
the upcoming version 19 react will have

138
00:05:27,479 --> 00:05:31,639
a compiler that to my understanding will

139
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:34,600
replace the virtual Dom and it'll make

140
00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:37,039
things faster and it will also automate

141
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:40,080
some of the tedious tasks uh making

142
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:42,280
react easier to work with overall now

143
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:44,560
most of the reasons to use react also

144
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:46,840
apply to the other frontend Frameworks

145
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:49,360
as well and if you ask me specifically

146
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:51,160
why react over the other ones I would

147
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:53,960
probably say jobs there's definitely a

148
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:57,080
lot more react jobs than the others also

149
00:05:53,960 --> 00:06:00,160
the ecosystem is huge when it comes to

150
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:02,600
um meta SSR Frameworks like next J s and

151
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,319
remix you have react native for mobile

152
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:06,919
development it's just it's definitely

153
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:09,919
the most popular now I'm going to be

154
00:06:06,919 --> 00:06:12,840
100% transparent with you guys the

155
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:14,800
reason that I use react and the reason

156
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:16,759
that I I do most of my courses and

157
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:21,199
videos on react is because of its

158
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:22,759
popularity to me vue.js and spelt do a

159
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:25,280
lot of things in a much more

160
00:06:22,759 --> 00:06:26,880
straightforward way so if you're not

161
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:28,360
caring about jobs maybe you're a

162
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:30,080
freelancer or maybe you're just trying

163
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:31,560
to build your own products

164
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:34,759
I would definitely look into other

165
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:37,680
Frameworks as well um especially spelt

166
00:06:34,759 --> 00:06:40,160
and and Vue because again I think react

167
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,639
just over complicates a lot of stuff

168
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:44,080
it's don't get me wrong it's a great

169
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:47,400
framework but if we're if we're just

170
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:49,520
looking strictly at how we write our

171
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:53,360
code using these Frameworks I think that

172
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:56,000
spelt and view are are easier um with

173
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:58,319
that said that is just my opinion so

174
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,199
take that with a grain of salt also

175
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:03,639
these Frameworks basically do the same

176
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:05,479
thing and once you learn one if you

177
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:07,599
learn react now and then you want to

178
00:07:05,479 --> 00:07:09,759
jump to view it's going to be easy you

179
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:11,479
just it's just syntax that changes the

180
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:13,599
the core of what you're actually doing

181
00:07:11,479 --> 00:07:15,319
is the same you're still writing

182
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:17,400
components you're still passing props

183
00:07:15,319 --> 00:07:18,560
you're still managing State it's just

184
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:21,120
different

185
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:24,080
syntax all right so speaking of

186
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:25,919
components components are the the core

187
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:28,759
concept of not just react but any

188
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:30,960
front-end framework and a component is a

189
00:07:28,759 --> 00:07:33,280
reusable piece piece of codee that can

190
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:35,160
be used to build elements on a page

191
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:38,199
components can kind of be thought of as

192
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:40,479
custom HTML elements and components can

193
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:42,759
be broken down into smaller ones this is

194
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:44,720
called composition and this is a great

195
00:07:42,759 --> 00:07:48,120
way to build uis because it allows you

196
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:51,199
to break down complex interfaces into

197
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:53,560
smaller more manageable pieces and this

198
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:56,000
makes your code easier to maintain and

199
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:58,639
scale and components can be either

200
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,599
classes or functions however classes are

201
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:02,800
kind of the older way of of doing things

202
00:08:00,599 --> 00:08:04,639
in react nowadays you're not really

203
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:06,560
going to see class-based components

204
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:08,840
they're all functional uh we will be

205
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:12,319
using functional components in this

206
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:14,680
course and in any other course I do um

207
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:16,400
components can also take in props which

208
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:18,639
are basically like arguments or

209
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:22,680
attributes and they can also hold their

210
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:23,919
own state or their own data now state is

211
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:26,039
another thing that you're going to have

212
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:27,800
to wrap your head around when doing when

213
00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:29,960
working in the front end State

214
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:32,440
represents the data that a component

215
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:34,640
manages internally it allows components

216
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:37,120
to store and manage their own uh their

217
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:39,479
own data which can change over time and

218
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:42,320
it'll change in response to user

219
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:43,959
interactions or other factors now state

220
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:46,360
is typically used for data that's

221
00:08:43,959 --> 00:08:49,959
expected to change such as user input

222
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:53,040
fetch data from apis or UI related data

223
00:08:49,959 --> 00:08:55,200
like whether a model is open or closed

224
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:57,480
and to Define state in a functional

225
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:59,760
component you can use a hook and I'll

226
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:02,360
talk more about hooks in a second um

227
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:05,320
you'll use the Ed State hook which is a

228
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:07,440
built-in react hook and this will return

229
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:10,760
an array with two elements the current

230
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:12,920
state value and the function to update

231
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:14,920
that state and we're again we're going

232
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:16,640
to get into this I know that just

233
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:19,240
hearing me say this doesn't tell you

234
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:20,839
much we will get into examples now

235
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:23,040
there's also something called Global

236
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:25,839
state which relates to the app as a

237
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:27,320
whole and not just a single component so

238
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:29,560
this would be something like the data

239
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:31,079
that you fetch from your database you

240
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:33,839
you probably want to share that with

241
00:09:31,079 --> 00:09:36,079
multiple components so there's ways to

242
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:38,560
handle this everything from just keeping

243
00:09:36,079 --> 00:09:41,399
your Global state in your main component

244
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:44,720
and passing it down to child components

245
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:46,680
to the react context API which is beyond

246
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:49,079
the scope of this tutorial but it is an

247
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:51,480
option within react you can also use a

248
00:09:49,079 --> 00:09:53,600
third-party State management system like

249
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:56,920
Redux okay now we're not going to get

250
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:59,880
into context or Redux um but we will

251
00:09:56,920 --> 00:10:01,920
look at some Global State later on now

252
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:04,360
if you've never used react before hooks

253
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:06,519
can be really intimidating they're also

254
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:08,480
difficult to explain so bear with me

255
00:10:06,519 --> 00:10:11,240
once we start using them it'll be more

256
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:13,600
clear now react hooks are functions that

257
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:15,880
enable functional components to use

258
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:17,880
State and other react features without

259
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:20,360
writing a class because like I said

260
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:21,800
react components used to be classes and

261
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:24,279
they used to have something called life

262
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:26,959
cycle methods which were methods that

263
00:10:24,279 --> 00:10:29,519
ran at specific times during the the

264
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:31,320
component rendering process and and

265
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:32,959
functional components don't have life

266
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:36,079
cycle methods because they're not a

267
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:37,880
class so hooks allow us to do the same

268
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:40,880
stuff that we could do within class

269
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:43,120
components such as set State such as

270
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:45,680
perform effects like data fetching on

271
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:47,880
load things like that and basically

272
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:49,639
right now at this point in your learning

273
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:52,240
the two main hooks that you need to know

274
00:10:49,639 --> 00:10:53,959
are use State and use effect the others

275
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:56,079
aren't really essential for you to know

276
00:10:53,959 --> 00:10:59,639
at least right now in fact three of them

277
00:10:56,079 --> 00:11:01,440
are being phased out in react 19 um as

278
00:10:59,639 --> 00:11:04,680
you can see all hooks start with the

279
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:06,399
word use so you can also create your own

280
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:08,120
custom hooks to use within your

281
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:10,160
components and that's not something you

282
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:12,680
need to know right now but just know

283
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:14,920
that you can create a hook that

284
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:17,120
basically does anything all right so I

285
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:19,160
just want to give you a full picture of

286
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:21,040
what a component looks like so we know

287
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:23,600
that it can have state associated with

288
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:27,600
it which is just data and it can also

289
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:29,760
take in props now the other part of a

290
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:33,680
component is the output and the output

291
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:36,720
is jsx or JavaScript syntax extension

292
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:39,440
and this is basically HTML or an HTML

293
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:41,720
like syntax within your JavaScript that

294
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:44,240
and that's what is actually returned

295
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:46,200
from a react component so this is

296
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:48,040
actually an example right here you can

297
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:50,959
see there's uh it's a function called

298
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:53,320
hero it's taking in some props a title

299
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:56,160
and subtitle with a default and then

300
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:57,480
it's returning what looks like HTML but

301
00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:01,320
this is actually

302
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:03,839
jsx okay what's great about jsx is that

303
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:05,639
it's Dynamic it's basically what HTML

304
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:07,360
would be if it were a programming

305
00:12:05,639 --> 00:12:10,680
language you can see right here we're

306
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:12,920
outputting title and subtitle which are

307
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:15,040
coming from these props all right you

308
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:17,720
can also have Expressions you can have

309
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:21,480
loops conditionals you can basically do

310
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:23,199
anything within your jsx all right so

311
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:26,000
there are some differences when it comes

312
00:12:23,199 --> 00:12:28,360
to HTML as you can see you can't use

313
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:31,160
class because that's a reserved word in

314
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:33,240
JavaScript so instead we use class name

315
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:35,440
also for if you let's say you have a

316
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:38,360
label with a four attribute that's going

317
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:40,480
to be changed to HTML 4 so there are

318
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:42,880
some slight differences but for the most

319
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:45,000
part it's just HTML all right now I was

320
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:46,920
a little hesitant to even add this page

321
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,680
because I I think it might confuse some

322
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:50,720
people so if you don't understand it

323
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:53,000
that's fine don't worry about it at the

324
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:55,279
moment so there's different types of

325
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,399
applications and websites you can build

326
00:12:55,279 --> 00:13:00,639
using react so what we're going to be

327
00:12:57,399 --> 00:13:02,560
doing today is a SP or a single page

328
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:05,399
application and this is what these

329
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:08,360
Frameworks were initially created for so

330
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:12,440
basically it loads a single HTML file an

331
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:14,199
index HTML in the browser and then it it

332
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:16,839
it loads a JavaScript bundle that

333
00:13:14,199 --> 00:13:19,680
includes your entire UI your entire

334
00:13:16,839 --> 00:13:22,600
application basically and this allows

335
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:25,519
our interface to be very interactive and

336
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:27,199
even if you go to a specific page like

337
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:30,040
let's say you click on a link and go to

338
00:13:27,199 --> 00:13:32,680
slab it's not actually loading the about

339
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:35,880
page on the server the JavaScript is

340
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:38,040
loading that content for you so spars

341
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:41,199
are like I said great for really fast

342
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:43,240
Dynamic interfaces but it can have some

343
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:45,720
issues when it comes to initial page

344
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:48,519
load times as well as SEO since the

345
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:51,079
content comes from JavaScript so the

346
00:13:48,519 --> 00:13:52,800
solution for that is to create a server

347
00:13:51,079 --> 00:13:56,199
side rendered app which you can do with

348
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:58,680
a framework like nextjs or remix now

349
00:13:56,199 --> 00:14:00,600
these Frameworks still they still use

350
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:04,519
react you can kind of think of it as a

351
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:06,079
wrapper around react and instead of

352
00:14:04,519 --> 00:14:08,320
everything being bundled in the

353
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:10,360
JavaScript the initial page load is

354
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:12,639
rendered on the server so this is good

355
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:16,519
for SEO it's also good for the you know

356
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:19,120
the initial page load time now an SSR or

357
00:14:16,519 --> 00:14:21,320
server side rendered app is a little

358
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:23,399
more difficult to deploy because you do

359
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:26,560
need a server a single page app you can

360
00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:30,160
pretty much deploy to any any type of

361
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:33,560
host um SSRS you use something like

362
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:37,560
versel or uh netlify or something like

363
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:41,680
that now the third option is static site

364
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:44,160
generation so a static site is where the

365
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:46,920
server generates a bunch of HTML files

366
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:49,600
at build time so we have Frameworks like

367
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:52,360
Gatsby and Astro that can do this and

368
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:53,880
those Frameworks also use react so I

369
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:55,320
know that this can get complicated

370
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:57,360
because there's just so many damn

371
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:59,519
Frameworks but just know that they're

372
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:01,800
all using react so what you learned

373
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:05,560
today still applies whether you're using

374
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:07,720
Gatsby whether you're using uh nextjs

375
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:11,639
Astro you can actually use a react or

376
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:13,600
view or spelt components um but yeah

377
00:15:11,639 --> 00:15:16,120
what you're learning today is basically

378
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:17,720
the core of of all this other stuff so

379
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:19,560
don't worry about learning this other

380
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:21,680
stuff right now just know that it is

381
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:23,800
available and just know that if you're

382
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:25,959
confused that's completely normal you

383
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:28,399
should be it's JavaScript you're always

384
00:15:25,959 --> 00:15:30,680
going to be confused and I just realized

385
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:33,160
this is react generate static HTML

386
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:35,199
that's not really accurate um it it

387
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:37,839
would be the The Meta framework like

388
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:40,120
Gatsby that is generating it not react

389
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:41,680
itself now there's a few ways to get

390
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:43,839
started with react we're going to be

391
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:46,639
using a tool called vit along with the

392
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:50,240
react plug-in and getting set up is as

393
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:52,959
easy as running this npm command now

394
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:56,160
create react app was the most popular

395
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:58,240
option to build a spa with react um and

396
00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:00,040
it's been around for a long time but

397
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:03,360
it's no longer recommended it's a bit

398
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:06,199
bloated it's uh slower and as far as I

399
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:08,759
know it's not supported anymore so vit

400
00:16:06,199 --> 00:16:11,399
is a newer Solution that's faster it has

401
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:13,560
a better developer experience it's built

402
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:16,440
on top of something called es build

403
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:18,480
which is a very fast JavaScript bundler

404
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:21,279
and it also has a built-in development

405
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:23,440
server with hot module replacement so

406
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:26,319
it's a great solution for building Spas

407
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:28,959
with react um and and other Frameworks

408
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:31,240
as well so that's it let's jump in and

409
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:32,759
let's get our hands dirty learning react

410
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:35,360
all right guys so real quick I just want

411
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:37,920
to explain how my crash courses go if

412
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:39,759
you're new to them so basically the

413
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:42,519
point of this is to teach you how to get

414
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:44,079
up and running with react in this case

415
00:16:42,519 --> 00:16:46,680
and we want to go over all the

416
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:49,680
fundamentals but I also want to create a

417
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:51,480
project and end up with something that

418
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,959
you can have that you built by the end

419
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:55,720
of it so this is what we're going to

420
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:58,519
create this react jobs website and it's

421
00:16:55,720 --> 00:17:01,319
just a uh job listings front end now as

422
00:16:58,519 --> 00:17:04,039
far as the data itself it's going to be

423
00:17:01,319 --> 00:17:06,199
coming from uh a mock backend that we're

424
00:17:04,039 --> 00:17:08,079
going to create with Jason server it's

425
00:17:06,199 --> 00:17:10,640
really simple basically we just create a

426
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:14,400
Json file with some data and we can then

427
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:16,039
send get get requests put post delete

428
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:18,160
and we're going to add crud

429
00:17:16,039 --> 00:17:21,360
functionality all right so as far as the

430
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:24,439
template here the The Design This is a

431
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:26,559
Tailwind theme that I created and in the

432
00:17:24,439 --> 00:17:29,120
repository you'll have your Source

433
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:31,360
folder with you know all your components

434
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:33,880
and react stuff and then this theme

435
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:38,360
filesor theme files is going to be just

436
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:40,919
the HTML files um basically just a theme

437
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:42,400
it's not going to actually fetch data or

438
00:17:40,919 --> 00:17:44,640
anything like that it'll all be

439
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:46,280
hardcoded but it'll have all the classes

440
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:48,679
and all the stuff that we need for

441
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:51,120
styling so we'll be copying some of that

442
00:17:48,679 --> 00:17:54,280
as we go along because I I I like it to

443
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:56,440
look decent now just to quickly go over

444
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:59,640
this the homepage we have a hero

445
00:17:56,440 --> 00:18:01,159
component navbar component some box es

446
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:03,360
and then we're going to fetch our jobs

447
00:18:01,159 --> 00:18:05,200
and list three of them on the homepage

448
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:07,679
we can toggle the description here just

449
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:10,480
to give you you know an example of State

450
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:12,760
uh component State and then if you click

451
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:14,880
read more it'll take you to the page The

452
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:17,320
Details page with all the info the

453
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:19,320
company info there's buttons to edit and

454
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:21,120
delete the jobs now we're not going to

455
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:23,080
get into authentication that's something

456
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:25,159
that would be separate from this crash

457
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:27,120
course I do have videos with all

458
00:18:25,159 --> 00:18:29,080
different types of authentication and

459
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:31,679
react but we'll have full frud

460
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:34,039
functionality we have our ad page here

461
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:37,039
to add a job we have our jobs page which

462
00:18:34,039 --> 00:18:40,440
will show all the jobs again having this

463
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:43,240
little toggle here so it's a pretty

464
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:45,280
simple project but I think that it's

465
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:47,600
it's a it's a good one to just kind of

466
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:49,679
break you into react and and how

467
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:53,039
everything works as far as components

468
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:54,559
props events things like that all right

469
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:56,200
so yeah that's what we'll be building

470
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:58,159
the repository link will be in the

471
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:59,159
description and as far as what you need

472
00:18:58,159 --> 00:19:01,760
you're just going to have to have

473
00:18:59,159 --> 00:19:03,919
node.js installed because we're using V

474
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:06,720
and we're using the node package manager

475
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:08,400
to set that up so npm comes with node.js

476
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:10,240
so just download that if you don't

477
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:12,120
already have it I would suggest

478
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:13,880
installing the react developer Tools in

479
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:16,280
your browser we'll probably use those at

480
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:18,120
some point you can see the components

481
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:20,640
through you know through your browser

482
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:23,120
and see any props and state and things

483
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:25,760
like that so it's helpful and then

484
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:27,120
react. deev is the new react website and

485
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:29,000
this is where you can find all the

486
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:31,559
documentation so you might want want to

487
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,880
just use that kind of as a supplement to

488
00:19:31,559 --> 00:19:36,159
the crash course all right so we can

489
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:38,760
close this stuff up here um I'm just

490
00:19:36,159 --> 00:19:41,880
going to keep the the react Dev website

491
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:44,320
open and I do have in Sublime Text I

492
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:46,400
have the theme files so if I need to

493
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:48,760
copy something from here you know to get

494
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:51,000
the HTML and the classes we'll go ahead

495
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:53,960
and just grab that so maybe just open

496
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,840
the theme files up somewhere all right

497
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:57,840
so we're going to start off by opening

498
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:59,679
the terminal and just go to wherever you

499
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:01,320
want to create your project folder I

500
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:05,000
have a folder called Dev that I'm going

501
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:07,480
to use and then we're going to run npm

502
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:10,200
create again make sure you have no JS

503
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:14,039
installed or npm won't work so we're

504
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:15,320
going to say create V at latest and then

505
00:20:14,039 --> 00:20:18,679
just whatever you want to call the

506
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:21,000
folder I'm going to call it react crash

507
00:20:18,679 --> 00:20:23,400
d224 but you might want to call it like

508
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:26,000
react jobs or something like that I'm

509
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:29,120
just naming it this for for you guys for

510
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:31,679
the repo and then as you can see you can

511
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:33,240
use vanilla JavaScript view react and

512
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:35,520
other Frameworks we're going to go ahead

513
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:37,200
and choose react and you can choose to

514
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:39,679
use typescript if you want I'm going to

515
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:41,799
go with just regular JavaScript and

516
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:46,159
that's it that creates basically a

517
00:20:41,799 --> 00:20:48,640
boilerplate app for us so we can CD into

518
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:51,000
the that folder that we just

519
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:53,360
created and then from here I'm going to

520
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:56,080
go ahead and open up visual studio code

521
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:59,360
with code Dot and if you're using

522
00:20:56,080 --> 00:21:01,760
something else that's fine um just uh

523
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:03,559
you know open open the folder in your in

524
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:06,320
your text editor or

525
00:21:03,559 --> 00:21:08,679
IDE so let's just take a look at the

526
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:11,679
file structure real quick so there's a v

527
00:21:08,679 --> 00:21:14,200
config file and this is for any

528
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:16,000
configurations for your Dev server as

529
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:18,720
you can see we're bringing in the react

530
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:21,400
plugin and using it here passing it into

531
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:23,440
this array that's because we chose react

532
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:25,520
when we were asked the questions one

533
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:27,520
thing I like to do is change the port

534
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:31,120
because by default it's I believe it's

535
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:33,200
517 three I prefer to use 3,000 for

536
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:36,559
frontend stuff so what we can do is add

537
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:38,840
in Ser a server object and then in that

538
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:40,559
server object we can say port and then

539
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:44,600
whatever you want so I'm going to use

540
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:46,760
3,000 so now if I open up I'm going open

541
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:49,600
up my terminal within VSS code my

542
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:51,559
integrated terminal and run first of all

543
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:54,360
npm install because as you can see

544
00:21:51,559 --> 00:21:56,320
there's no node modules folder so we

545
00:21:54,360 --> 00:22:00,559
need to install the dependencies which

546
00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:04,200
are react react Dom and vit and then we

547
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:06,200
have some plugins for um eslint as well

548
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:09,159
as some types for

549
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:10,600
typescript all right so once we do that

550
00:22:09,159 --> 00:22:15,600
as you can see in the package.json

551
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:17,520
there's a Dev script so we can run npm

552
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:19,880
run

553
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:22,279
Dev and for me it's going to open on

554
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:24,960
3,000 because I changed that value in

555
00:22:22,279 --> 00:22:27,159
the config so let's open that up and you

556
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:29,440
should see a page like this just a

557
00:22:27,159 --> 00:22:31,320
landing page all right so now we have

558
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:33,559
the dev server running let's just talk

559
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:35,960
about the structure here for a minute so

560
00:22:33,559 --> 00:22:38,640
the index HTML remember this is a single

561
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:41,279
page application and and this file is

562
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:43,640
the single page because this loads in

563
00:22:41,279 --> 00:22:46,400
the browser and then everything else

564
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:48,039
loads through JavaScript and as you can

565
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:51,080
see here we're actually including the

566
00:22:48,039 --> 00:22:52,960
main. jsx file in the source folder

567
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:54,799
including that as a module which is

568
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:58,000
really cool it's different than how you

569
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:59,720
know create react app works with webpack

570
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:03,520
so here I'm just going to change the

571
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:05,320
title to react jobs and that should

572
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:07,799
change as soon as I save it you can see

573
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:09,880
up here um and then the way that this

574
00:23:07,799 --> 00:23:11,679
works if you're not familiar with

575
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:14,320
frontend Frameworks they they all pretty

576
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:17,279
much do this this same type of thing we

577
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:19,559
have a div or I should say single page

578
00:23:17,279 --> 00:23:22,279
applications do the same thing there's a

579
00:23:19,559 --> 00:23:24,520
div and it has an ID of root if we go

580
00:23:22,279 --> 00:23:26,960
into the source folder this is our our

581
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:30,400
react application and the entry point is

582
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:33,320
this main.js T file and in here we're

583
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:35,200
bringing in react react Dom which is the

584
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:38,000
library that allows it to work with the

585
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:40,919
document object model or the browser and

586
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:44,200
then on that react Dom object we have a

587
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:46,159
create root and that gets passed in an

588
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:49,919
element and as you can see we're we're

589
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:51,840
selecting that root element by ID and

590
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:54,520
then we're calling this render method

591
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:56,640
and you can render whatever you want as

592
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:58,880
your application and in this case we

593
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:02,240
have this app component which comes from

594
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:04,679
this app.jsx file now I could change

595
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:08,919
this to anything I want if I put an H1

596
00:24:04,679 --> 00:24:11,039
here and say hello and I save that as

597
00:24:08,919 --> 00:24:13,520
you can see that's what's rendering as

598
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:16,960
my application and it's styled because

599
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:18,520
of this index. CSS so I want to just

600
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:22,080
clean this up a bit I'm just going to

601
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:24,600
undo that and put the app back um and

602
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:26,480
then you also have this strict mode

603
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:28,440
which is a wrapper component that'll

604
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:29,840
check for potential problems in your app

605
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:33,320
app so it'll check for things like

606
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:36,159
deprecated and unsafe life cycle methods

607
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:38,960
uh Legacy context API usage things like

608
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:41,600
that so what I want to do is is a little

609
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:44,200
bit of cleanup so as far as the CSS you

610
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:48,039
can see it comes with two CSS files

611
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:50,679
index.css and app.css we're going to be

612
00:24:48,039 --> 00:24:52,880
using Tailwind so we need to install

613
00:24:50,679 --> 00:24:56,120
that and set it up um I'm just going to

614
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:57,159
keep the index CSS so let's delete the

615
00:24:56,120 --> 00:25:00,919
app

616
00:24:57,159 --> 00:25:02,880
CSS and and the app.jsx is our main

617
00:25:00,919 --> 00:25:05,799
component and basically this is all the

618
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:07,679
stuff you see right now on the homepage

619
00:25:05,799 --> 00:25:09,720
so what I'm going to do is completely

620
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:11,919
wipe that away and just create uh

621
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:13,799
basically an empty component now

622
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:15,600
components can they're functions and you

623
00:25:13,799 --> 00:25:18,039
can do a regular function so for

624
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:21,279
instance we could do function app or you

625
00:25:18,039 --> 00:25:23,600
can do an arrow function so con con app

626
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:25,480
and then use an arrow and you can type

627
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:27,880
it out if you want but I would suggest

628
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:31,240
using this extension here this uh it's

629
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:33,840
called e ps7 react Redux react native

630
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:35,960
Snippets and this gives you easy

631
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:39,200
Snippets that you can use to generate

632
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:42,480
components so what I like to do is RA

633
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:44,799
Ace which is react Arrow function

634
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:47,159
component and then export which will be

635
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:49,679
at the bottom so you see if I hit tab or

636
00:25:47,159 --> 00:25:52,159
enter it gives me an arrow function and

637
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:55,919
has the export at the bottom now there's

638
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:59,000
other Snippets like ra a if we do

639
00:25:55,919 --> 00:26:01,760
rafc it does do an arrow function that's

640
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:04,120
what the a is but the export is here as

641
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:07,360
opposed to the bottom and then for the

642
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:09,000
regular function I believe is RFC so now

643
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:11,039
you can see it's using the regular

644
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:15,120
function syntax so you can use any of

645
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:18,919
these but I'll be doing ra fce so if I

646
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:22,000
save that now we should just see app now

647
00:26:18,919 --> 00:26:24,440
I want to get rid of all the CSS and as

648
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:26,440
you can see in the main. jsx it is

649
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:28,679
including the CSS file and I'm going to

650
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:32,399
keep that but let's just get rid of

651
00:26:28,679 --> 00:26:36,320
everything in that file for now okay so

652
00:26:32,399 --> 00:26:39,080
now we just have just an unstyled uh

653
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:41,120
website so yeah that's pretty much how

654
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:44,799
this works we have this div with the ID

655
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:47,760
of root and then we're inserting our app

656
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:51,320
into that using this render method all

657
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:54,039
right now let's uh let's get Tailwind

658
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:55,600
set up and there's uh some steps we can

659
00:26:54,039 --> 00:26:59,120
follow if you just

660
00:26:55,600 --> 00:27:01,840
Google let's say V

661
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:04,399
V react

662
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:08,760
Tailwind so right here install Tailwind

663
00:27:04,399 --> 00:27:11,039
CSS with v so basically we need to

664
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:12,840
install uh let's see we already did this

665
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:15,480
created a v project so now we just need

666
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:18,080
to install tailwind postcss and auto

667
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:19,520
prefixer so I'm just going to grab that

668
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:21,559
and then I'm going to open up a new

669
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:23,919
console I'm going to just let that one

670
00:27:21,559 --> 00:27:25,080
run the server and we'll go ahead and

671
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:28,480
run

672
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:31,559
that and then we want to initialize tail

673
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:34,159
with dasp so this this will create a

674
00:27:31,559 --> 00:27:37,200
Tailwind config file and the- P will

675
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:38,840
create a post CSS config file so let's

676
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:41,679
go ahead and run

677
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:45,159
that and now you can see Tailwind doc

678
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:48,080
config post css. config then the

679
00:27:45,159 --> 00:27:49,679
Tailwind config we want to have this so

680
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:52,799
I'm just going to copy that whole thing

681
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:54,919
go to Tailwind config and just paste

682
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:57,360
that in all right so basically it's

683
00:27:54,919 --> 00:28:00,559
going to watch anything that has a jst

684
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:03,240
tsj SX or TSS extension it's going to

685
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:05,960
look for Tailwind classes in any of

686
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:07,720
those files in the source folder now

687
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:10,799
there is a couple things I want to add

688
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:13,480
here so in extend I'm going to say font

689
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:17,360
family and I want to use the robotto

690
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:20,519
font so I'm going to say sanss and then

691
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:23,440
in an array we can pass in robotto or

692
00:28:20,519 --> 00:28:26,080
whatever font you want to use and then

693
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:28,960
Sans serif so it just allows you to pass

694
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:32,360
in a font stack and then and also I want

695
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:35,760
to have a a certain grid class for The

696
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:38,039
Details page that's 7030 basically the

697
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:41,559
left column will be 70 the right will be

698
00:28:38,039 --> 00:28:42,960
30 so I'm going to say grid uh grid

699
00:28:41,559 --> 00:28:45,440
template

700
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:50,080
columns and then we're going to just

701
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:53,200
pass in here a string and say

702
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:55,440
70-30 so that'll be the class and then

703
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:58,880
we want here

704
00:28:55,440 --> 00:29:01,519
70% space and then 28% % we'll leave a

705
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:04,080
little bit of room there okay so that's

706
00:29:01,519 --> 00:29:07,559
going to allow us to add a class later

707
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:09,559
on that we need now my spell check is

708
00:29:07,559 --> 00:29:13,320
showing these blue squiggly lines so I'm

709
00:29:09,559 --> 00:29:15,360
just going to disable that

710
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:17,640
extension just to get rid of those

711
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:20,200
because that could be a little

712
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:23,360
confusing okay so that's the Tailwind

713
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:26,480
config now we just need to go to our

714
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:28,440
index CSS and add these three lines

715
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:32,399
which is going to load Tailwind so right

716
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:34,799
here index CSS add those save

717
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:37,600
it and then we should be all set so if

718
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:40,120
we go back to our

719
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:42,480
application should uh let's see we might

720
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:45,519
have to reload let's just stop the

721
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:45,519
server and run it

722
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:53,559
again um no utility classes were

723
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:55,600
detected oh we don't have any Tailwind

724
00:29:53,559 --> 00:29:57,440
classes but that's the only reason it's

725
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:59,559
saying this but you can see the font has

726
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:02,159
changed and there's no margin or padding

727
00:29:59,559 --> 00:30:04,440
so Tailwind is being included in fact we

728
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:07,919
can go to our app component and remember

729
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:10,080
with jsx we can't use class we use class

730
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:14,880
name so let's say class name and we'll

731
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:16,840
do text- 5xl which is a Tailwind class

732
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:20,360
and there we go so Tailwind is now

733
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:23,080
working so let's close that up

734
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:25,000
and yeah we'll just put this here close

735
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:28,000
that all right so we're going to talk a

736
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:30,799
little bit about jsx so every react

737
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:32,760
component is going to return jsx that's

738
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:35,200
what this is right here which is an H

739
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:37,080
HTML like syntax and I'm going to give

740
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:40,360
you some examples of some things you can

741
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:42,399
do here because it is dynamic um but one

742
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:45,399
rule that you have to remember is that

743
00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:47,480
you can only return a single element

744
00:30:45,399 --> 00:30:50,360
okay you can have as much stuff in that

745
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:52,960
element as you want like inside this div

746
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:55,559
but it can only return one so if I try

747
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:58,799
to for instance uh and you can put

748
00:30:55,559 --> 00:31:01,159
parentheses around this as well whoops

749
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:03,880
parentheses and you know put it on uh

750
00:31:01,159 --> 00:31:06,360
multiple lines but if I were to add a

751
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:09,080
paragraph here like that you'll see I'm

752
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:11,919
already getting an error in vs code it

753
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:14,600
says jsx Expressions must have one

754
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:16,360
parent element so if I save that that's

755
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:19,120
going to give us an error same error

756
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:22,679
over here because I'm returning a div

757
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:24,600
and a paragraph now if I wanted this div

758
00:31:22,679 --> 00:31:28,039
and this paragraph then I could simply

759
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:29,120
wrap it in a single element so I could

760
00:31:28,039 --> 00:31:32,159
say

761
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:34,279
div uh whoops I hate when it does this

762
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:36,960
so I could say div and then end that

763
00:31:34,279 --> 00:31:38,639
here and that's absolutely fine okay so

764
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:40,760
just remember that it has to be wrapped

765
00:31:38,639 --> 00:31:43,200
in a single element now you might not

766
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:45,200
want an actual div here so what you can

767
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:48,039
do is use what's called a fragment and

768
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:50,039
it's just an empty HTML tag so just like

769
00:31:48,039 --> 00:31:52,159
this so if I do that you can see that

770
00:31:50,039 --> 00:31:54,639
still works but now it doesn't have a

771
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:58,039
surrounding div in the actual

772
00:31:54,639 --> 00:32:00,960
Dom all right so just remember that now

773
00:31:58,039 --> 00:32:03,760
to give you kind of a a little jsx crash

774
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:05,840
course let's say we want to put a

775
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:08,480
dynamic variable here so above the

776
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:10,360
return I can just write JavaScript so

777
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:12,240
for instance I'll create a variable

778
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:14,240
called name and this isn't part of the

779
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:17,320
project it's just to give you some

780
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:20,639
examples so we'll do name and then I can

781
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:24,039
put that value anywhere within my jsx

782
00:32:20,639 --> 00:32:26,440
wrapped in um curly braces so I could

783
00:32:24,039 --> 00:32:29,039
say hello and then curly braces name and

784
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:31,200
you see I get hello John

785
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:33,080
and it doesn't have to be just a single

786
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:37,360
variable it could be an expression for

787
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:43,000
so for example I could say const x = 10

788
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:46,039
and const Y = 20 and then I could

789
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:49,559
say um let's go under that we'll put

790
00:32:46,039 --> 00:32:52,639
another paragraph and I'll say the sum

791
00:32:49,559 --> 00:32:56,440
of and we'll put in

792
00:32:52,639 --> 00:33:00,519
X X and Y is and then I could do an

793
00:32:56,440 --> 00:33:03,760
expression I could say X x + y and if I

794
00:33:00,519 --> 00:33:06,120
save that I get the sum of 10 and 20 is

795
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:08,799
30 so basically you could put whatever

796
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:12,840
you want in these in these curly

797
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:15,880
braces now we can also use loops and we

798
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:19,639
can render something called a list so

799
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:22,039
let's add up here let's say cons names

800
00:33:19,639 --> 00:33:24,799
and say we'll make this an array and

801
00:33:22,039 --> 00:33:26,760
we'll just put some names in here so

802
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:31,240
Brad

803
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:33,480
Mary uh Joe and Sarah so we get some

804
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:36,840
names and let's say I want to Loop over

805
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:39,600
these and output them in the browser so

806
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:41,519
we can create a list by let's put this

807
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:43,440
in a ul and it doesn't have to be a UL

808
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:46,080
it could be anything but I basically

809
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:48,480
want a list item that has these names

810
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:51,120
inside so what we can do is open up some

811
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:53,519
curly braces take our names array and

812
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:56,240
then we use map which is just the the

813
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:59,200
vanilla JavaScript high order array

814
00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:02,559
method that takes in a function but

815
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:06,120
we're going to return some jsx for each

816
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:08,879
one so we'll say map and then

817
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:10,399
name and then in here we can have

818
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:12,399
whatever we'd like I'm going to use a

819
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:15,520
list item and then we should have access

820
00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:17,720
to each name so this creates what we

821
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:19,960
call a list if we check it out now

822
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:23,599
you'll see the names are all in a

823
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:26,520
list all right now if I open up my

824
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:29,639
console we're going to see an error or a

825
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:32,440
warning and and let's see it says me

826
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:34,919
just reload this okay so it says each

827
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:37,440
child in a list should have a unique key

828
00:34:34,919 --> 00:34:40,000
prop so when you create a list whatever

829
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:43,320
this element is inside the map has to

830
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:46,359
have a unique key prop so we'll say key

831
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:48,639
now if we had an ID in this array like

832
00:34:46,359 --> 00:34:50,720
if it was objects with IDs we could use

833
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:53,520
that but since we don't what we can do

834
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:55,960
is get the index by passing in a second

835
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:58,240
argument here and then for the key we'll

836
00:34:55,960 --> 00:35:00,040
say that's going to equal and if you're

837
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:02,760
going to set this to something Dynamic

838
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:05,760
then you use curly braces so we'll say

839
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:08,839
key equals index and then if we reload

840
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:13,240
that that error goes away so that's a

841
00:35:08,839 --> 00:35:17,119
list now we can also use um conditionals

842
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:20,720
in within jsx now I can't I can't use

843
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:23,160
like an if statement in here in in U

844
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:25,240
curly braces like I can't do this if

845
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:28,599
something um because it has to be

846
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:31,000
basically a oneline expression um um one

847
00:35:28,599 --> 00:35:34,240
thing you could do is you could have

848
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:39,400
different returns so let's say we have

849
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:41,000
let's say logged in and set that to True

850
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:42,119
right and then you might do something

851
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:45,520
like

852
00:35:42,119 --> 00:35:49,160
if logged in so I'm doing this above the

853
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:52,079
return so if logged in then I could

854
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:53,280
return I don't know we'll just say H1

855
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:56,920
and then

856
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:58,520
hello member so if I did that then I see

857
00:35:56,920 --> 00:36:01,160
Hello member and none of this is going

858
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:03,359
to render but usually you're going to

859
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:06,040
want to have the conditional somewhere

860
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:08,079
in here so in that case what we could do

861
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:11,640
is get rid of that let's go

862
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:14,400
underneath um the UL and we could use a

863
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:21,520
Turner we can say if loged

864
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:24,880
in then let's show an H1 and we'll say

865
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:29,560
hello member

866
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:29,560
else then we'll show

867
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:34,880
we'll say

868
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:37,480
hello guest so now if we take a look it

869
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:41,280
says hello member and if I change logged

870
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:42,760
in to false it says hello guest now

871
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:44,680
let's say you don't want to show hello

872
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:46,720
guest you just want to show hello member

873
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:48,599
if they're logged in so couple things

874
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:50,760
you could do you could just put an empty

875
00:36:48,599 --> 00:36:54,040
string here so now it doesn't show

876
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:55,720
anything or you could get rid of this

877
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:57,200
the colon here and instead of using a

878
00:36:55,720 --> 00:37:01,480
turn eror you could just use a double

879
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:04,680
amp per so basically this is going to

880
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:06,839
return this if this is true so right now

881
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:10,440
it doesn't show anything but if I change

882
00:37:06,839 --> 00:37:13,280
logged in to true I should probably just

883
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:16,880
make this smaller so if I change logged

884
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:19,160
in to true now it says hello member okay

885
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:21,680
so you can do all kinds of dynamic stuff

886
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:23,520
in here and I like to say that jsx is

887
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:26,240
what HTML would be if it were a

888
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:28,119
programming language and it had logic

889
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:30,359
now for styling

890
00:37:28,119 --> 00:37:32,480
there's a couple ways you can do this so

891
00:37:30,359 --> 00:37:35,280
obviously you can have your CSS file and

892
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:36,920
you can add class uh class names okay

893
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:38,800
remember you don't want to use class you

894
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:40,440
want to use class name um but if you

895
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:42,599
want to put inline style you can

896
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:46,040
actually do that within your JavaScript

897
00:37:42,599 --> 00:37:48,960
within your jsx so let's say

898
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:53,280
for um I don't know I guess this this

899
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:56,040
hello John right here let's add style

900
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:58,200
now we're going to pass in here double

901
00:37:56,040 --> 00:38:00,960
curly braces if you're adding inline

902
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:03,119
style like this and let's say we want to

903
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:06,000
change the color so we would say color

904
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:09,440
colon and then a string of red so it's

905
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:12,240
not quite CSS but you have the same

906
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:14,079
properties um but one difference is

907
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:15,720
you're not going to have for like font

908
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:17,800
size like let's put a comma here you're

909
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:20,400
not going to do font Dash size like you

910
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:23,599
would in CSS you're going to do font

911
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:27,079
size like that and we'll change that to

912
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:28,680
let's say 24 pixels all right so if I

913
00:38:27,079 --> 00:38:31,319
save that now you'll see that that's

914
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:33,280
styled differently now you can also put

915
00:38:31,319 --> 00:38:37,000
this stuff in a variable if you wanted

916
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:39,680
to so up here let's say we want to do

917
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:44,800
const and let's call this we'll just

918
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:49,160
call it Styles oops con Styles and we're

919
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:52,280
going to set that to an object that has

920
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:55,240
color uh color red so make sure you put

921
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:58,839
it uh quotes because it's a string and

922
00:38:55,240 --> 00:39:01,480
then font size and for that we'll say

923
00:38:58,839 --> 00:39:03,640
let's say 55 pixels and then what you

924
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:06,599
can do is instead of setting this you

925
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:10,160
could just simply set it to uh in this

926
00:39:06,599 --> 00:39:13,280
case you would do single uh brackets or

927
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:16,240
curly braces and then just add in

928
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:17,680
Styles okay so now it's using this but

929
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:19,359
we're not going to need to do anything

930
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:21,440
like this because we're using Tailwind

931
00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:23,839
so all we have to do is add

932
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:25,440
classes all right so none of this has to

933
00:39:23,839 --> 00:39:27,400
do with the project I just wanted to

934
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:29,520
kind of give you a little intro a little

935
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:31,839
crash course to jsx so what I'm going to

936
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:35,079
do is just get rid of all of it and ra

937
00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:38,280
fce once again and just clear all that

938
00:39:35,079 --> 00:39:40,520
up we can close this up for now so we

939
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:42,640
want to start our project and the way

940
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:45,160
that I want to do this is just start off

941
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:47,400
by copying the entire homepage and

942
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:49,520
putting it into our app our main app

943
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:52,400
component and then break it up into

944
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:54,880
smaller components so let's do that I'm

945
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:58,119
going to go to Sublime Text because

946
00:39:54,880 --> 00:40:00,480
that's where I have my theme files

947
00:39:58,119 --> 00:40:03,200
and we're going to go to index HTML okay

948
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:05,520
so just open that up now we don't need

949
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:08,960
the head stuff that's already in the the

950
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:10,760
single page the index HTML so let's grab

951
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:11,599
everything that's in the body so from

952
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:15,160
this

953
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:18,200
nav and then we want to go down

954
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:20,920
to uh the last section we don't we don't

955
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:23,720
want the um the script there so just

956
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:26,280
just grab this and then we're going to

957
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:28,839
put this as the return so let's return

958
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:32,079
some parentheses and then paste all that

959
00:40:28,839 --> 00:40:34,160
stuff in now I'm sorry we can't do that

960
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:36,200
because remember it has to be inside of

961
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:38,839
a parent so what we can do is use a

962
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:39,640
fragment and then paste everything in

963
00:40:38,839 --> 00:40:41,760
that

964
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:44,760
fragment now remember we don't want to

965
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:46,720
use class it will work um well one thing

966
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:49,839
that's not going to work is the comments

967
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:53,240
here so you either have to comment it

968
00:40:49,839 --> 00:40:55,119
out with jsx syntax like this or just

969
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:58,880
get rid of the comments uh I'm just

970
00:40:55,119 --> 00:41:00,160
going to I'm going to get rid of

971
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:03,760
I guess I'll keep them we'll just

972
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:05,920
comment these out so yeah you definitely

973
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:08,400
want to either delete a comment them out

974
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:11,319
because you're going to get an error so

975
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:12,800
job listing three and I just put the

976
00:41:11,319 --> 00:41:17,119
comments in just to kind of break

977
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:20,720
everything up was that all of them let's

978
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:21,850
see this one here developers and

979
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:23,520
employers

980
00:41:21,850 --> 00:41:25,800
[Music]

981
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:27,680
hero and to comment it out I'm just

982
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:30,599
highlighting and doing command and

983
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:33,240
forward slash or control forward slash

984
00:41:30,599 --> 00:41:35,119
logo we don't need that comment all

985
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:38,000
right so now if I save that you'll see

986
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:39,800
it actually does work um but if I were

987
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:43,160
to open up the console it's going to

988
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:45,359
tell me invalid Dom property class did

989
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:47,000
you mean class name so it's telling us

990
00:41:45,359 --> 00:41:48,839
to change these so what we can do is

991
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:51,079
just highlight the first one and we can

992
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:52,839
do a commander control shift L that will

993
00:41:51,079 --> 00:41:56,079
select all of them and then we're going

994
00:41:52,839 --> 00:41:58,560
to change it to class name save it and

995
00:41:56,079 --> 00:42:00,440
then that should if we reload that will

996
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:03,079
get rid of the the

997
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:05,920
warning okay so now we have our entire

998
00:42:03,079 --> 00:42:08,599
page inside of this the app component

999
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:10,720
which obviously isn't what we want uh we

1000
00:42:08,599 --> 00:42:13,640
want to break everything up into

1001
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:15,319
components so let's start off we'll just

1002
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:18,040
go from top to bottom we'll start with

1003
00:42:15,319 --> 00:42:20,079
the nav bar so that's this entire nav

1004
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:21,640
tag and everything in it so what we'll

1005
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:24,599
do is in the source folder we're going

1006
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:26,800
to create a new folder called

1007
00:42:24,599 --> 00:42:29,880
components and in components I'm going

1008
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:33,240
to create a file called navb bar. jsx

1009
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:35,359
now a component can have a JS or a jsx

1010
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:39,880
extension and if you're using typescript

1011
00:42:35,359 --> 00:42:41,280
it can be TS or TSX I prefer jsx so

1012
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:44,760
we're just going to do that and we'll do

1013
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:46,280
ra fce again and it's going to call it

1014
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:49,559
navbar because that's the name of the

1015
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:51,920
file that's fine so I'll save that now

1016
00:42:49,559 --> 00:42:53,640
to bring that in and use it into our

1017
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:58,079
main component we're going to go up to

1018
00:42:53,640 --> 00:43:01,280
the top here and say import navbar

1019
00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:03,240
from do/ components navbar and then we

1020
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:05,440
can put that anywhere in here we want

1021
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:09,680
let's just go right above the actual nav

1022
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:12,200
tag and say navbar just like a an HTML

1023
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:15,000
tag and there it is so now we're we're

1024
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:17,800
importing and using that component so

1025
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:19,119
let's take the the entire nav tag and

1026
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:22,960
everything in

1027
00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:24,920
it and let's cut that if we save it you

1028
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:27,000
can see now it's gone and I'm going to

1029
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:30,040
go into the navbar and I want to put

1030
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:33,240
that that as the return so we'll put

1031
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:35,760
some parentheses and then paste that in

1032
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:38,280
save it and now it's back okay but it's

1033
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:40,440
in its own component and if we were to

1034
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:44,440
use the react Dev tools so if you open

1035
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:47,040
up your uh tools down here and you go to

1036
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:49,280
components you can see we have our

1037
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:51,359
navbar component and it will show you

1038
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:53,599
any props or state which obviously right

1039
00:43:51,359 --> 00:43:57,200
now we don't have any but that's a

1040
00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:59,960
separate component a UI component so now

1041
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:01,920
Let's uh let's do some stuff here you

1042
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:04,359
notice that the image isn't showing the

1043
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:06,480
logo so first thing we need to bring it

1044
00:44:04,359 --> 00:44:09,280
into our file structure and I'm going to

1045
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:11,520
put it in the assets folder right now

1046
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:14,760
there's just this react

1047
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:17,559
SVG uh which we can just we can get rid

1048
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:20,040
of that and let's bring over so if you

1049
00:44:17,559 --> 00:44:22,559
go in your theme files and you go to

1050
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:24,800
images you'll have the logo PNG so I'm

1051
00:44:22,559 --> 00:44:27,559
going to bring that actually let's

1052
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:30,119
create let's create a folder are called

1053
00:44:27,559 --> 00:44:32,880
images in the assets folder and then

1054
00:44:30,119 --> 00:44:35,440
we'll bring the logo into

1055
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:38,920
that all right and then what we can do

1056
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:40,040
is bring that image in to our navbar so

1057
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:45,359
we can say

1058
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:47,760
import let's say import logo from and

1059
00:44:45,359 --> 00:44:49,480
then we need to navigate let's see we're

1060
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:53,920
in components so we want to go up one

1061
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:56,040
level into assets and then into images

1062
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:57,680
and then

1063
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:59,559
logo.png

1064
00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:02,960
okay so we're going to bring that file

1065
00:44:59,559 --> 00:45:04,720
in and then we can go down to the image

1066
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:08,440
where we have the logo which is right

1067
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:10,520
here and let's replace the source we're

1068
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:13,720
going to make it Dynamic so we need our

1069
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:16,280
curly braces and then we can say logo

1070
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:18,599
and there we go so now the logo shows so

1071
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:20,319
now the Navar is its own component we'll

1072
00:45:18,599 --> 00:45:22,640
come back to this later when we deal

1073
00:45:20,319 --> 00:45:25,359
with the the routes and links and and

1074
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:28,000
that stuff but now let's deal with the

1075
00:45:25,359 --> 00:45:29,599
hero so the hero is this section right

1076
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:32,119
here so I'm going to just get rid of

1077
00:45:29,599 --> 00:45:34,720
that comment and then I'm going to cut

1078
00:45:32,119 --> 00:45:37,440
this entire section and then in

1079
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:41,319
components let's create a file called

1080
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:45,160
hero. jsx and we'll do

1081
00:45:41,319 --> 00:45:48,319
rafc and let's get rid of that and then

1082
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:50,599
I'm going to paste in that section save

1083
00:45:48,319 --> 00:45:53,119
it and then let's go to our appjs and do

1084
00:45:50,599 --> 00:45:55,680
the same thing we'll bring

1085
00:45:53,119 --> 00:46:00,280
in

1086
00:45:55,680 --> 00:46:03,280
hero here hero and then we can embed

1087
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:06,040
it like

1088
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:07,960
that okay save and we still get the same

1089
00:46:06,040 --> 00:46:11,000
thing but now the hero is in its own

1090
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:13,319
component in fact if we look at the dev

1091
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:17,000
tools again if we go to components

1092
00:46:13,319 --> 00:46:20,000
you'll see we have navbar and we have

1093
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:22,079
hero now I want to go over props because

1094
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:24,280
remember I said we can pass in props to

1095
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:26,160
a component which are basically

1096
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:28,359
attributes so let's say we want to be

1097
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:31,400
able to pass in in two things we want to

1098
00:46:28,359 --> 00:46:33,000
pass in the title which would be this

1099
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:35,680
and the subtitle which would be the

1100
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:37,119
smaller text so we can pass it in let's

1101
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:41,520
say

1102
00:46:37,119 --> 00:46:44,440
title and for now I'll just say test

1103
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:48,119
title and then let's pass in

1104
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:51,040
subtitle and I'll say this is the

1105
00:46:48,119 --> 00:46:53,960
subtitle okay so by doing that nothing

1106
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:56,480
happens right so I mean I'm just passing

1107
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:59,160
it in I'm not using it in any way so

1108
00:46:56,480 --> 00:47:01,440
let's go go into the hero close that up

1109
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:05,040
for now and then what happens is that

1110
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:06,520
props it'll get passed in here and you

1111
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:08,359
can call this anything I'm going to call

1112
00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:09,720
it props for now but in a minute I'm

1113
00:47:08,359 --> 00:47:12,960
going to show you how we can destructure

1114
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:16,400
it as well so we want to put the title

1115
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:18,640
here instead of this hardcoded content

1116
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:22,200
so what we would do is open up our curly

1117
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:25,839
braces and we can say props do title and

1118
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:30,359
then here for this one we'll say

1119
00:47:25,839 --> 00:47:32,960
props props dos subtitle and if I save

1120
00:47:30,359 --> 00:47:35,920
that now whatever I'm passing in is

1121
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:38,839
going to get displayed as the title and

1122
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:41,119
subtitle now usually what you'll do is

1123
00:47:38,839 --> 00:47:43,559
destructure this so instead of of just

1124
00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:46,839
props we could add some curly braces in

1125
00:47:43,559 --> 00:47:50,200
here and then destructure the title and

1126
00:47:46,839 --> 00:47:52,440
the subtitle like that and then wherever

1127
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:55,520
we use this we don't have to do props

1128
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:59,359
dot we can just do title and then here

1129
00:47:55,520 --> 00:48:03,440
we can just do subtitle and that still

1130
00:47:59,359 --> 00:48:06,800
works now you can also have default

1131
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:09,400
props so all we have to do is up here

1132
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:14,960
let's say for the default we want what

1133
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:15,920
we had become a react Dev and then for

1134
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:21,280
the

1135
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:23,440
subtitle set that uh what was it

1136
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:25,760
find find the react

1137
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:30,480
[Music]

1138
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:33,400
job that fits your skill

1139
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:36,280
set okay so if I save that nothing

1140
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:38,359
happens because we're passing in the

1141
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:42,200
title and subtitle whatever we pass in

1142
00:48:38,359 --> 00:48:45,520
is going to override the default props

1143
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:48,319
so let's get rid of these put it back to

1144
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:49,960
just hero and now we have our default

1145
00:48:48,319 --> 00:48:53,200
prop content

1146
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:56,400
showing now we can also have wrapper

1147
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:58,440
components so in addition to just being

1148
00:48:56,400 --> 00:49:00,359
able to to do this with the self-closing

1149
00:48:58,440 --> 00:49:02,559
tag we could do something like let's say

1150
00:49:00,359 --> 00:49:05,200
we had a card component and then you

1151
00:49:02,559 --> 00:49:07,960
want to put you know whatever content

1152
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:11,000
inside of it so let's do that for these

1153
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:13,160
two cards here all right now instead of

1154
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:15,280
of bringing in the card component that

1155
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:17,520
we're going to create into this file and

1156
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:20,319
having all that content here I want to

1157
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:22,640
keep this app file clean so what we'll

1158
00:49:20,319 --> 00:49:26,200
do is create a component to hold all of

1159
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:27,839
our cards and we'll call that home cards

1160
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:29,920
I know we didn't create this yet but

1161
00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:32,400
let's just embed it here and then bring

1162
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:34,520
it in we'll say

1163
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:38,440
import home

1164
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:39,880
cards uh from and it's going to be in

1165
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:43,079
components

1166
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:44,480
slash home cards okay and I know we

1167
00:49:43,079 --> 00:49:46,839
haven't created it yet that's why we

1168
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:48,640
have an error but let's go ahead we can

1169
00:49:46,839 --> 00:49:52,040
get rid of that comment and then let's

1170
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:53,559
copy this entire section which ends

1171
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:55,680
right

1172
00:49:53,559 --> 00:49:57,599
here okay so we're gonna not we're going

1173
00:49:55,680 --> 00:50:00,280
to cut that

1174
00:49:57,599 --> 00:50:02,440
and let's go into

1175
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:04,280
components right and in components we're

1176
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:06,040
going to create a new file called home

1177
00:50:04,280 --> 00:50:11,839
cards.

1178
00:50:06,040 --> 00:50:15,319
jsx rafc and then let's do get rid of

1179
00:50:11,839 --> 00:50:18,319
this and then we'll paste in that

1180
00:50:15,319 --> 00:50:20,720
section and then it should yeah there we

1181
00:50:18,319 --> 00:50:22,720
go so it's working again so now this

1182
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:25,319
right here is its own component called

1183
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:27,960
home cards but what I want to do is have

1184
00:50:25,319 --> 00:50:31,040
each one of these be a card component

1185
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:33,040
that we can wrap the content in so

1186
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:34,960
whatever content we wrap will have this

1187
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:37,720
background color and I also want to pass

1188
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:40,920
in that background color as a prop or

1189
00:50:37,720 --> 00:50:45,319
pass in the class as a prop so let's

1190
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:47,480
create another component called card.

1191
00:50:45,319 --> 00:50:51,480
jsx

1192
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:54,359
rafc okay now this card component is

1193
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:57,040
going to take in as a prop it's going to

1194
00:50:54,359 --> 00:50:59,079
take in uh we're going to destruct rure

1195
00:50:57,040 --> 00:51:01,319
it's going to take in children so

1196
00:50:59,079 --> 00:51:04,280
children is what we use for whatever we

1197
00:51:01,319 --> 00:51:07,040
wrap so if we pass in like an H1 into

1198
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:09,280
the card component we wrap the card or

1199
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:12,880
wrap the H1 in a card then this would be

1200
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:14,200
that H1 so that children we just want to

1201
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:17,559
display

1202
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:20,280
that um in the return now I do want to

1203
00:51:17,559 --> 00:51:22,799
have the the card styling like the

1204
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:27,160
background and the the Shadow and all

1205
00:51:22,799 --> 00:51:30,599
that so let's um let's make this a div

1206
00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:35,520
that we return but let's add some

1207
00:51:30,599 --> 00:51:40,000
classes so we'll say BG D gray

1208
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:44,079
d00 let's do padding

1209
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:49,119
-6 let's do rounded

1210
00:51:44,079 --> 00:51:51,880
dlg and let's do Shadow Das

1211
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:53,599
MD all right so we'll do that and then

1212
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:55,200
in here is where we want to Output the

1213
00:51:53,599 --> 00:51:58,480
children which is going to be whatever

1214
00:51:55,200 --> 00:52:02,799
it is we wrap so I'll save that and now

1215
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:04,319
let's go into home cards and let's

1216
00:52:02,799 --> 00:52:07,920
import

1217
00:52:04,319 --> 00:52:10,400
cards oops cards

1218
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:13,760
from uht

1219
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:16,240
slash not cards just card

1220
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:19,160
singular okay and then let's see where

1221
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:22,319
we have so we have the grid class and

1222
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:25,480
then these right here right so this BG

1223
00:52:22,319 --> 00:52:29,000
gray and then this BG Indigo these are

1224
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:32,640
these two so I want to take everything

1225
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:34,599
that's in the BG gray div right here

1226
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:36,599
right this H2 and all this actually you

1227
00:52:34,599 --> 00:52:40,359
know what let's just take the whole

1228
00:52:36,599 --> 00:52:43,839
thing or wait a minute no we'll take

1229
00:52:40,359 --> 00:52:48,200
everything in it so the H2 the paragraph

1230
00:52:43,839 --> 00:52:50,160
and the link I'm going to grab that and

1231
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:53,559
I'm going to copy it and then I'm going

1232
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:54,960
to cut or not cut but just delete this

1233
00:52:53,559 --> 00:52:57,000
entire

1234
00:52:54,960 --> 00:53:01,160
div and then this this is where I want

1235
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:04,000
to put the card and I want to wrap this

1236
00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:07,240
stuff okay so this card now is basically

1237
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:09,680
just taking the place of the div this BG

1238
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:11,599
gray div and then let's do the same

1239
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:14,839
thing here we'll take the H2 the

1240
00:53:11,599 --> 00:53:17,200
paragraph and the link we'll cut that

1241
00:53:14,839 --> 00:53:18,760
and then we'll replace this div with

1242
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:21,400
another

1243
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:23,839
card because you can have as many of the

1244
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:26,640
of the same component as you want then

1245
00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:28,119
we'll paste that in now if I save you'll

1246
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:29,920
notice that they're both they both have

1247
00:53:28,119 --> 00:53:33,119
a gray background because that's what

1248
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:35,200
we're using in the the card wrapper

1249
00:53:33,119 --> 00:53:38,480
component but what I want to be able to

1250
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:40,599
do is pass in a class like this so I can

1251
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:44,119
change the background color so let's add

1252
00:53:40,599 --> 00:53:47,040
another prop here so in addition to that

1253
00:53:44,119 --> 00:53:52,720
it'll take in BG and I want to set a

1254
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:54,240
default of the BG Das gray- 100 so

1255
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:57,599
that's what it will be if you don't pass

1256
00:53:54,240 --> 00:54:00,160
in a BG all right now here we want to

1257
00:53:57,599 --> 00:54:03,119
make this class name Dynamic so instead

1258
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:05,520
of hardcoding the be this right here we

1259
00:54:03,119 --> 00:54:08,119
want it to be this variable so how do we

1260
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:10,400
do that well we have to instead of just

1261
00:54:08,119 --> 00:54:13,680
using quotes we have to it's going to be

1262
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:17,240
dynamic so we need to use curly braces

1263
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:19,000
so let's do that and then let's get rid

1264
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:22,359
of

1265
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:24,920
uh where's my cursor let's get rid of

1266
00:54:22,359 --> 00:54:26,799
this right here BG

1267
00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:30,400
gray and then we're we're going to put

1268
00:54:26,799 --> 00:54:33,440
some back ticks in here so here and then

1269
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:36,119
here okay so right now it's just it has

1270
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:38,720
these hardcoded classes but since we're

1271
00:54:36,119 --> 00:54:41,480
using a template literal now I can put a

1272
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:45,200
variable in here so I'm just going to do

1273
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:47,599
that and then put the BG variable here

1274
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:50,400
which by default will be this but I can

1275
00:54:47,599 --> 00:54:53,119
also pass in a new one so if I save that

1276
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:55,319
now you'll see that's still gray but if

1277
00:54:53,119 --> 00:55:00,240
I were to go to the second card here and

1278
00:54:55,319 --> 00:55:02,440
then pass in b G and set that to let's

1279
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:07,359
say BG D

1280
00:55:02,440 --> 00:55:09,799
Indigo Das 100 and save now I've changed

1281
00:55:07,359 --> 00:55:12,359
that so you can use props to not only

1282
00:55:09,799 --> 00:55:13,440
change the content but to also change

1283
00:55:12,359 --> 00:55:16,040
the

1284
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:19,280
styling so now we've come to the browse

1285
00:55:16,040 --> 00:55:21,440
jobs and now we want to start to work

1286
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:23,119
with data a little bit now we don't have

1287
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:25,640
a backend yet so we're not going to be

1288
00:55:23,119 --> 00:55:30,440
fetching these jobs just yet what we'll

1289
00:55:25,640 --> 00:55:34,559
do for now is just use a Json file so

1290
00:55:30,440 --> 00:55:37,280
let's um just open up the so from the

1291
00:55:34,559 --> 00:55:40,119
repository in the source folder there's

1292
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:44,079
a jobs. Json file so I want you to take

1293
00:55:40,119 --> 00:55:47,160
that and bring that over to your Source

1294
00:55:44,079 --> 00:55:50,319
folder now at the moment this is an

1295
00:55:47,160 --> 00:55:52,000
object that has a job a named jobs array

1296
00:55:50,319 --> 00:55:53,680
inside of it and the reason for that is

1297
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:55,640
because with Json server which we're

1298
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:57,799
going to use later that's how you need

1299
00:55:55,640 --> 00:56:00,480
to format it but for now what I want you

1300
00:55:57,799 --> 00:56:02,839
to do is just just have the array so we

1301
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:04,760
can get rid of this the curly brace and

1302
00:56:02,839 --> 00:56:07,480
then the jobs so it's just starts with

1303
00:56:04,760 --> 00:56:10,039
the bracket and then down at the bottom

1304
00:56:07,480 --> 00:56:12,920
just get rid of that curly brace okay so

1305
00:56:10,039 --> 00:56:15,920
now we just have an array of jobs and we

1306
00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:18,240
can bring this into the files where we

1307
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:20,960
file where we need it now we could bring

1308
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:23,000
it into you know into the uh we can

1309
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:26,720
close home cards but we could bring the

1310
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:28,640
data into the app component and then we

1311
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:30,760
could use it here but like I said I want

1312
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:33,920
to keep this app component clean so why

1313
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:36,119
don't we put the listings into its own

1314
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:38,119
component and then we'll have a single

1315
00:56:36,119 --> 00:56:41,119
listing component which will be you know

1316
00:56:38,119 --> 00:56:43,680
this this block so in components let's

1317
00:56:41,119 --> 00:56:45,599
create a new file and we'll call this

1318
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:47,319
job

1319
00:56:45,599 --> 00:56:50,839
listings.

1320
00:56:47,319 --> 00:56:53,599
jsx and let's do rafc and then let's

1321
00:56:50,839 --> 00:56:55,559
grab from the app this entire section

1322
00:56:53,599 --> 00:56:59,359
under browse jobs we can get rid of that

1323
00:56:55,559 --> 00:56:59,359
comment and then this

1324
00:56:59,960 --> 00:57:03,720
section see so this

1325
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:10,240
ends right here actually let's see do we

1326
00:57:08,599 --> 00:57:12,640
want

1327
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:15,200
the H we'll put the we'll put the other

1328
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:16,880
section with the the view all button in

1329
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:19,920
its own component so let's just take

1330
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:21,319
this one section cut it and then in the

1331
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:24,680
job

1332
00:57:21,319 --> 00:57:28,760
listings get rid of that paste this in

1333
00:57:24,680 --> 00:57:30,960
save it let's go back to app let's

1334
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:34,280
import job

1335
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:36,839
listings and then let's add it here so

1336
00:57:34,280 --> 00:57:38,559
job listings so you can see how we're

1337
00:57:36,839 --> 00:57:40,400
cleaning this file up now it's going to

1338
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:41,599
look the same right except now this is

1339
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:44,440
in its own

1340
00:57:41,599 --> 00:57:47,039
component now I want this data because

1341
00:57:44,440 --> 00:57:49,559
right now if we look at this the data is

1342
00:57:47,039 --> 00:57:52,160
just hardcoded in the HTML I want it to

1343
00:57:49,559 --> 00:57:54,680
come from that Json file like I said

1344
00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:56,920
ultimately it's going to come from Json

1345
00:57:54,680 --> 00:57:58,960
server which is a mock back in but for

1346
00:57:56,920 --> 00:58:02,240
now we'll just bring in the data

1347
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:04,799
directly so we can do that by just

1348
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:08,720
saying import

1349
00:58:04,799 --> 00:58:12,440
jobs from and we want to go let's see up

1350
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:14,559
one level into and then we want jobs.

1351
00:58:12,440 --> 00:58:16,280
Json and just to make sure that we're

1352
00:58:14,559 --> 00:58:18,359
getting that we can just do a quick

1353
00:58:16,280 --> 00:58:21,119
console log of

1354
00:58:18,359 --> 00:58:26,240
jobs and then if

1355
00:58:21,119 --> 00:58:27,480
we check out console see we have an an

1356
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:30,119
array of

1357
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:31,440
jobs all right now we want to show those

1358
00:58:30,119 --> 00:58:34,799
jobs

1359
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:36,640
here um so what we'll do and this right

1360
00:58:34,799 --> 00:58:39,440
here that you're seeing the log in my

1361
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:41,920
browser this is the the console ninja

1362
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:44,119
extension not the browser my editor this

1363
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:46,200
is uh from the console ninja extension

1364
00:58:44,119 --> 00:58:47,039
if you want to check that out it's

1365
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:51,599
pretty

1366
00:58:47,039 --> 00:58:53,079
cool so let's see we want to create a

1367
00:58:51,599 --> 00:58:55,599
list remember I showed you a little

1368
00:58:53,079 --> 00:58:59,559
while ago that if you have an array

1369
00:58:55,599 --> 00:59:01,880
which is is what this is jobs you can

1370
00:58:59,559 --> 00:59:04,400
Loop through it and create a list using

1371
00:59:01,880 --> 00:59:07,240
the map method so let's figure out where

1372
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:10,119
we need to do this so we have the grid

1373
00:59:07,240 --> 00:59:13,240
here so why don't we inside of the grid

1374
00:59:10,119 --> 00:59:16,440
create a list that will have a div like

1375
00:59:13,240 --> 00:59:19,000
this with the BG white rounded XEL

1376
00:59:16,440 --> 00:59:21,039
around all the jobs okay just like we

1377
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:23,920
see here same thing but we'll be using

1378
00:59:21,039 --> 00:59:26,119
the actual data from the file so I'm

1379
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:30,480
going to go right above where it says

1380
00:59:26,119 --> 00:59:33,720
job listing one and let's take let's say

1381
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:35,720
jobs. map and then that's going to take

1382
00:59:33,720 --> 00:59:38,960
in a function and we're going to return

1383
00:59:35,720 --> 00:59:42,960
some jsx from that and the J and that's

1384
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:45,160
going to take job and then the jsx that

1385
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:48,000
I want is one of these divs one of these

1386
00:59:45,160 --> 00:59:52,559
boxes so this div which

1387
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:52,559
ends right here I'm going to grab

1388
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:57,520
that and I'm going to cut that okay we

1389
00:59:56,200 --> 01:00:01,359
don't need that we don't need these

1390
00:59:57,520 --> 01:00:03,319
other listings now so let's get rid of

1391
01:00:01,359 --> 01:00:05,960
job listing

1392
01:00:03,319 --> 01:00:08,640
two and job

1393
01:00:05,960 --> 01:00:11,160
listing three which

1394
01:00:08,640 --> 01:00:14,079
ends right here make sure just make sure

1395
01:00:11,160 --> 01:00:15,960
you get rid of the right divs all right

1396
01:00:14,079 --> 01:00:20,480
so we're just we're really cleaning this

1397
01:00:15,960 --> 01:00:21,599
up as well and then inside here right

1398
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:24,160
inside the

1399
01:00:21,599 --> 01:00:26,839
function is where I want to paste in

1400
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:28,480
that single div

1401
01:00:26,839 --> 01:00:30,599
now if I save this you'll see it's going

1402
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:33,119
to show it a bunch of times it's showing

1403
01:00:30,599 --> 01:00:35,799
the same data because that data is

1404
01:00:33,119 --> 01:00:37,920
hardcoded but it's showing what 10

1405
01:00:35,799 --> 01:00:41,160
because that's what I have in the Json

1406
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:44,880
file so if we look here we have oh no

1407
01:00:41,160 --> 01:00:47,079
it's six yeah ID 1 through six so it's

1408
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:51,599
showing me six boxes but it's all the

1409
01:00:47,079 --> 01:00:53,839
same data so all we have to do now is

1410
01:00:51,599 --> 01:00:56,359
replace the hardcoded data with the data

1411
01:00:53,839 --> 01:00:59,599
from each job which we're getting right

1412
01:00:56,359 --> 01:01:04,720
here so for where it says fulltime let's

1413
01:00:59,599 --> 01:01:06,319
change that to job Dot and then type so

1414
01:01:04,720 --> 01:01:08,200
now those should be a little different

1415
01:01:06,319 --> 01:01:12,119
fulltime this one says

1416
01:01:08,200 --> 01:01:14,000
part-time okay so for the title this

1417
01:01:12,119 --> 01:01:18,319
right here the hardcoded title let's get

1418
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:20,520
rid of that and let's say job. tile now

1419
01:01:18,319 --> 01:01:22,359
all the titles are different then we

1420
01:01:20,520 --> 01:01:23,480
have the description let's get rid of

1421
01:01:22,359 --> 01:01:27,920
that and

1422
01:01:23,480 --> 01:01:27,920
say um

1423
01:01:28,079 --> 01:01:32,000
job.

1424
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:35,160
description okay now those are different

1425
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:37,119
then we have the salary so this right

1426
01:01:35,160 --> 01:01:40,559
here uh let me see how are those

1427
01:01:37,119 --> 01:01:44,640
salaries formatted do they have okay so

1428
01:01:40,559 --> 01:01:46,680
it's just the whatever K2 whatever K so

1429
01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:50,119
the slash year will leave there but

1430
01:01:46,680 --> 01:01:53,119
we'll replace this with

1431
01:01:50,119 --> 01:01:53,119
job.

1432
01:01:53,520 --> 01:01:57,839
salary um that should be a big k

1433
01:01:59,720 --> 01:02:06,079
let me just fix

1434
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:08,599
this all right so let's see what else do

1435
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:11,240
we have here the

1436
01:02:08,599 --> 01:02:14,079
location um and by the way you see we do

1437
01:02:11,240 --> 01:02:15,599
have the font awesome it tag here we

1438
01:02:14,079 --> 01:02:17,839
don't we're not using the font awesome

1439
01:02:15,599 --> 01:02:20,400
CDN so it's not showing up the little

1440
01:02:17,839 --> 01:02:22,520
map marker but I'm going to show you an

1441
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:25,160
extension that we can use called react

1442
01:02:22,520 --> 01:02:27,240
icons where you can uh basically bring

1443
01:02:25,160 --> 01:02:29,319
in your font awesome icons as a

1444
01:02:27,240 --> 01:02:32,359
component but we'll do that in a minute

1445
01:02:29,319 --> 01:02:34,520
let's um change this

1446
01:02:32,359 --> 01:02:36,319
to

1447
01:02:34,520 --> 01:02:38,400
job.

1448
01:02:36,319 --> 01:02:40,039
location and now you can see that the

1449
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:43,240
locations are

1450
01:02:40,039 --> 01:02:45,839
different and then finally the link here

1451
01:02:43,240 --> 01:02:47,839
is going to job. HTML which obviously

1452
01:02:45,839 --> 01:02:51,559
isn't correct ultimately we want to be

1453
01:02:47,839 --> 01:02:54,920
able to go to our website slash and then

1454
01:02:51,559 --> 01:02:58,920
jobs and then slash whatever that job ID

1455
01:02:54,920 --> 01:03:01,480
is so so let's change this

1456
01:02:58,920 --> 01:03:05,760
to uh template literal so we'll put in

1457
01:03:01,480 --> 01:03:10,640
some back ticks and we'll say slash job

1458
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:13,079
slash and then we want the ID so job. ID

1459
01:03:10,640 --> 01:03:15,839
like that okay so if I click it it's

1460
01:03:13,079 --> 01:03:18,880
going to go to job SL2 in this case

1461
01:03:15,839 --> 01:03:20,920
which doesn't exist yet but that's fine

1462
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:23,359
now another thing I'd like to do is to

1463
01:03:20,920 --> 01:03:26,079
make this an actual component because

1464
01:03:23,359 --> 01:03:27,839
right now in our job listings yes we

1465
01:03:26,079 --> 01:03:30,400
have a list but we're just outputting a

1466
01:03:27,839 --> 01:03:33,000
bunch of HTML let's make this into a

1467
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:36,000
single component that we can then show

1468
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:39,559
for every job so in components let's

1469
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:41,119
create a new file called job listing

1470
01:03:39,559 --> 01:03:44,559
singular.

1471
01:03:41,119 --> 01:03:47,680
jsx rafc and then that's going to take

1472
01:03:44,559 --> 01:03:50,079
in as a prop we'll destructure and

1473
01:03:47,680 --> 01:03:52,119
that's going to take in a job and then

1474
01:03:50,079 --> 01:03:54,119
what we can do is in the job listings

1475
01:03:52,119 --> 01:03:56,359
within the map this div we're going to

1476
01:03:54,119 --> 01:03:59,160
grab that

1477
01:03:56,359 --> 01:04:03,559
ends right here we're going to cut it

1478
01:03:59,160 --> 01:04:04,960
and then here we want to paste that in

1479
01:04:03,559 --> 01:04:07,400
and basically it's going to get passed

1480
01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:10,119
in that job prop and then we'll use it

1481
01:04:07,400 --> 01:04:13,440
in all these different areas so now in

1482
01:04:10,119 --> 01:04:17,440
job listings we can simply

1483
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:19,960
import job listing the singular and then

1484
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:22,640
what we want to render for each job is

1485
01:04:19,960 --> 01:04:27,000
going to be job listing and it's going

1486
01:04:22,640 --> 01:04:28,599
to get passed in a job prop

1487
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:30,000
okay now remember when you have a list

1488
01:04:28,599 --> 01:04:31,720
it also has to have a key or you're

1489
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:33,920
going to get that that error so let's

1490
01:04:31,720 --> 01:04:36,520
say key equals and I'm going to set that

1491
01:04:33,920 --> 01:04:38,599
to the jobs ID because that's going to

1492
01:04:36,520 --> 01:04:40,920
be unique remember it has to be a unique

1493
01:04:38,599 --> 01:04:43,359
value so if I save and reload you can

1494
01:04:40,920 --> 01:04:46,440
see that it's still it's

1495
01:04:43,359 --> 01:04:49,279
working okay and if we look at the dev

1496
01:04:46,440 --> 01:04:51,760
tools here if we go to components you

1497
01:04:49,279 --> 01:04:54,520
can see all of our you can see our tree

1498
01:04:51,760 --> 01:04:56,920
of components Navar hero in the home

1499
01:04:54,520 --> 01:05:00,200
cards we have two cards components in

1500
01:04:56,920 --> 01:05:02,240
job listings we have six job listing

1501
01:05:00,200 --> 01:05:04,760
components all right and if we look at

1502
01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:07,520
that you'll see over here the props

1503
01:05:04,760 --> 01:05:10,319
which is all the job data so you can see

1504
01:05:07,520 --> 01:05:13,279
how this UI is nice and organized now

1505
01:05:10,319 --> 01:05:16,119
right everything is in UI components and

1506
01:05:13,279 --> 01:05:18,160
it's easy to manage so if you were using

1507
01:05:16,119 --> 01:05:21,079
just vanilla JavaScript you would have

1508
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:23,440
this giant monolithic file where you're

1509
01:05:21,079 --> 01:05:26,000
just selecting all these elements using

1510
01:05:23,440 --> 01:05:28,000
whatever a query selector uh and then

1511
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:30,079
you'd have to just create all these

1512
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:32,480
different functions and it's just it

1513
01:05:30,079 --> 01:05:35,119
gets very messy but with react or not

1514
01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:37,400
just react but any front-end framework

1515
01:05:35,119 --> 01:05:40,279
you have everything nice and neat for

1516
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:43,559
your UI okay and it might seem like more

1517
01:05:40,279 --> 01:05:46,680
work at first but as you your

1518
01:05:43,559 --> 01:05:50,880
application scales you you'll be you'll

1519
01:05:46,680 --> 01:05:52,880
learn to appreciate it all right so on

1520
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:54,880
the homepage I actually don't want to

1521
01:05:52,880 --> 01:05:57,960
show all of these I only want to show

1522
01:05:54,880 --> 01:06:00,079
three um but I also want to use the same

1523
01:05:57,960 --> 01:06:04,720
job listings component when we get to

1524
01:06:00,079 --> 01:06:07,599
the jobs page so trying to think of

1525
01:06:04,720 --> 01:06:10,599
how how I want to do it right now I

1526
01:06:07,599 --> 01:06:13,079
think right now let's just go to job

1527
01:06:10,599 --> 01:06:16,880
listings and what we can do

1528
01:06:13,079 --> 01:06:19,599
is uh let's see instead of just using

1529
01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:21,520
jobs directly down here and and looping

1530
01:06:19,599 --> 01:06:26,400
through let's do this let's say

1531
01:06:21,520 --> 01:06:27,920
const recent jobs and let's set set that

1532
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:30,400
to the jobs array and then we're going

1533
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:33,599
to use slice and we'll say we want to

1534
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:36,119
get from zero to three so we only want

1535
01:06:33,599 --> 01:06:38,880
the first three and then we'll replace

1536
01:06:36,119 --> 01:06:41,880
this with recent jobs so now it's only

1537
01:06:38,880 --> 01:06:44,039
going to Loop over those three save that

1538
01:06:41,880 --> 01:06:47,240
and there we

1539
01:06:44,039 --> 01:06:49,400
go all right so this final thing this

1540
01:06:47,240 --> 01:06:51,799
button if we look at our appjs that's

1541
01:06:49,400 --> 01:06:54,520
the last thing we have so let's put that

1542
01:06:51,799 --> 01:06:57,400
in its own component so we'll cut that

1543
01:06:54,520 --> 01:07:03,920
section and then in components let's

1544
01:06:57,400 --> 01:07:08,960
create view all jobs. jsx

1545
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:08,960
rafc and we'll replace this with that

1546
01:07:09,079 --> 01:07:13,880
section okay and for the link here let's

1547
01:07:12,119 --> 01:07:17,000
change that to

1548
01:07:13,880 --> 01:07:19,440
just slash jobs because when we start to

1549
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:21,839
use the router that's what it'll be and

1550
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:27,480
then in the app file we can just bring

1551
01:07:21,839 --> 01:07:31,279
that in so import View um what do I call

1552
01:07:27,480 --> 01:07:33,559
it yeah view all jobs why isn't it

1553
01:07:31,279 --> 01:07:33,559
coming

1554
01:07:34,559 --> 01:07:41,319
up

1555
01:07:37,160 --> 01:07:44,039
slash slash view all jobs and

1556
01:07:41,319 --> 01:07:48,520
then embed it

1557
01:07:44,039 --> 01:07:51,400
here save it and there we go so now our

1558
01:07:48,520 --> 01:07:54,599
app file is nice and neat so what I'd

1559
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:57,319
like to do next is get into State a

1560
01:07:54,599 --> 01:07:59,240
little bit and the use State hook so

1561
01:07:57,319 --> 01:08:02,119
remember there's two types of State you

1562
01:07:59,240 --> 01:08:04,400
have component state which relates to a

1563
01:08:02,119 --> 01:08:07,000
single component so one of these right

1564
01:08:04,400 --> 01:08:10,440
navbar hero and then you have app level

1565
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:12,640
or Global state which you can it relates

1566
01:08:10,440 --> 01:08:16,239
to the entire app and you can pass down

1567
01:08:12,640 --> 01:08:20,560
to components um so what I want to look

1568
01:08:16,239 --> 01:08:24,199
at now is is is component State and I

1569
01:08:20,560 --> 01:08:26,679
want to go into the job listing

1570
01:08:24,199 --> 01:08:29,520
component so this right here here and

1571
01:08:26,679 --> 01:08:32,279
basically I want to be able to toggle

1572
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:35,040
this description from being short where

1573
01:08:32,279 --> 01:08:36,719
it ends around here and then we can have

1574
01:08:35,040 --> 01:08:38,960
a button that says show more that we

1575
01:08:36,719 --> 01:08:41,199
click and it'll show the rest so

1576
01:08:38,960 --> 01:08:44,480
basically we'll have a piece of State

1577
01:08:41,199 --> 01:08:46,759
called show full description okay and we

1578
01:08:44,480 --> 01:08:49,759
can change that based on if we click

1579
01:08:46,759 --> 01:08:51,640
that button so let's come up here and if

1580
01:08:49,759 --> 01:08:53,480
you're going to add State you need to

1581
01:08:51,640 --> 01:08:56,359
use the Ed State hook so we're going to

1582
01:08:53,480 --> 01:09:00,120
import use state and that's going to be

1583
01:08:56,359 --> 01:09:02,480
from react okay now the way this works

1584
01:09:00,120 --> 01:09:04,679
as I briefly showed you in the slides

1585
01:09:02,480 --> 01:09:08,120
we're going to come above the return the

1586
01:09:04,679 --> 01:09:10,679
output and we're going to have an some

1587
01:09:08,120 --> 01:09:11,759
brackets here and we want to set that to

1588
01:09:10,679 --> 01:09:14,239
use

1589
01:09:11,759 --> 01:09:18,080
State okay now this is going to pertain

1590
01:09:14,239 --> 01:09:20,120
to the the show full description and

1591
01:09:18,080 --> 01:09:21,799
it's going to be a true or false value

1592
01:09:20,120 --> 01:09:24,159
and in here you want to put whatever you

1593
01:09:21,799 --> 01:09:27,719
want as the default so I'm going to say

1594
01:09:24,159 --> 01:09:31,199
false I don't want it to show uh flass

1595
01:09:27,719 --> 01:09:33,480
false I don't want it to show by default

1596
01:09:31,199 --> 01:09:35,239
and then in here we have two things the

1597
01:09:33,480 --> 01:09:37,440
name of the state itself which I'm going

1598
01:09:35,239 --> 01:09:38,960
to call show

1599
01:09:37,440 --> 01:09:41,199
fo

1600
01:09:38,960 --> 01:09:43,120
description and then the second is going

1601
01:09:41,199 --> 01:09:45,400
to be the name of the function that we

1602
01:09:43,120 --> 01:09:47,960
call to change that state and it's going

1603
01:09:45,400 --> 01:09:49,759
to be whatever this is with just set in

1604
01:09:47,960 --> 01:09:53,719
front of it so in this case it would be

1605
01:09:49,759 --> 01:09:57,719
set show full

1606
01:09:53,719 --> 01:10:01,920
description and camel case all right so

1607
01:09:57,719 --> 01:10:05,840
now let's get the description so I'm

1608
01:10:01,920 --> 01:10:09,360
going to go right above the return here

1609
01:10:05,840 --> 01:10:11,280
and I'm going to say let description and

1610
01:10:09,360 --> 01:10:14,920
I'm going to set that to the

1611
01:10:11,280 --> 01:10:16,640
job. description that's you know the job

1612
01:10:14,920 --> 01:10:22,679
that's being passed in for each one of

1613
01:10:16,640 --> 01:10:22,679
these and then if let's say

1614
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:30,000
if uh we'll say if not show full

1615
01:10:28,480 --> 01:10:33,159
description

1616
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:36,360
then let's basically just cut off some

1617
01:10:33,159 --> 01:10:38,880
of it so we'll take that description and

1618
01:10:36,360 --> 01:10:41,640
we'll set it equal to whatever that

1619
01:10:38,880 --> 01:10:43,040
whatever that description is except I'm

1620
01:10:41,640 --> 01:10:46,360
going to use the

1621
01:10:43,040 --> 01:10:50,040
substring method to cut it a little bit

1622
01:10:46,360 --> 01:10:52,800
so we'll say 0 to 90 and then I want to

1623
01:10:50,040 --> 01:10:55,320
add onto it an ellipses The the three

1624
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:58,640
dots so I'm going to concatenate three

1625
01:10:55,320 --> 01:11:01,520
three dots onto it and then what we can

1626
01:10:58,640 --> 01:11:04,400
do is just replace job do description

1627
01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:06,080
with that description variable so now if

1628
01:11:04,400 --> 01:11:07,719
I save that you can see that they all

1629
01:11:06,080 --> 01:11:09,320
got shorter and they have the little

1630
01:11:07,719 --> 01:11:11,679
ellipses on the

1631
01:11:09,320 --> 01:11:14,239
end all right so just to kind of

1632
01:11:11,679 --> 01:11:16,360
reiterate I haven't done anything with

1633
01:11:14,239 --> 01:11:20,320
this state yet all we've done is take

1634
01:11:16,360 --> 01:11:22,560
the job description and if the value of

1635
01:11:20,320 --> 01:11:26,239
show full description is false which it

1636
01:11:22,560 --> 01:11:27,960
is by default then it's going to cut off

1637
01:11:26,239 --> 01:11:29,840
okay it's going to cut off after 90

1638
01:11:27,960 --> 01:11:32,400
characters and add the

1639
01:11:29,840 --> 01:11:34,520
ellipses so now we want to have a little

1640
01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:37,159
button that we can click and this is

1641
01:11:34,520 --> 01:11:38,480
going to get us into events as well um

1642
01:11:37,159 --> 01:11:41,600
but we want to be able to click that and

1643
01:11:38,480 --> 01:11:44,080
show the full description so we can call

1644
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:46,360
this to change that so let's go down

1645
01:11:44,080 --> 01:11:47,840
here and let's add that button so I'm

1646
01:11:46,360 --> 01:11:50,080
going to put

1647
01:11:47,840 --> 01:11:52,040
it we going to go right under the

1648
01:11:50,080 --> 01:11:54,360
description which is right

1649
01:11:52,040 --> 01:11:57,080
here okay and then we're going to add a

1650
01:11:54,360 --> 01:12:00,360
button and I'm G to add some classes to

1651
01:11:57,080 --> 01:12:03,880
this let's do text-

1652
01:12:00,360 --> 01:12:08,280
Indigo um text Indigo

1653
01:12:03,880 --> 01:12:10,760
500 and let's do margin bottom

1654
01:12:08,280 --> 01:12:11,760
five and then I'm also going to add in

1655
01:12:10,760 --> 01:12:14,199
on

1656
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:16,840
Hover then we want

1657
01:12:14,199 --> 01:12:20,920
text- Indigo

1658
01:12:16,840 --> 01:12:22,600
D600 and then in the button text so this

1659
01:12:20,920 --> 01:12:24,360
I want this is going to depend on the

1660
01:12:22,600 --> 01:12:26,320
state okay so this is where we show

1661
01:12:24,360 --> 01:12:27,760
something different based on the state

1662
01:12:26,320 --> 01:12:30,080
well we've already done that with you

1663
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:33,440
know cutting it off short but I'm going

1664
01:12:30,080 --> 01:12:35,880
to have a a conditional in here Turner

1665
01:12:33,440 --> 01:12:37,679
and I'm going to say if show if show

1666
01:12:35,880 --> 01:12:42,239
full description is

1667
01:12:37,679 --> 01:12:45,600
true then I want this um I want this

1668
01:12:42,239 --> 01:12:46,639
text to say less else then I want it to

1669
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:49,639
say

1670
01:12:46,639 --> 01:12:54,560
more okay so if we save that check it

1671
01:12:49,639 --> 01:12:57,080
out so it says more because set um set

1672
01:12:54,560 --> 01:12:59,520
show fold description is false if I make

1673
01:12:57,080 --> 01:13:01,159
it true by default it's going to show

1674
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:03,159
all the text and then this is going to

1675
01:13:01,159 --> 01:13:06,600
say less so you can see just the value

1676
01:13:03,159 --> 01:13:08,360
of that state changes my component so

1677
01:13:06,600 --> 01:13:10,679
I'm going to put it back to false and

1678
01:13:08,360 --> 01:13:14,320
then let's make an event so when we

1679
01:13:10,679 --> 01:13:16,120
click that we then set that state to

1680
01:13:14,320 --> 01:13:17,840
just the opposite if it's true it'll be

1681
01:13:16,120 --> 01:13:22,679
set to false if it's false it'll be set

1682
01:13:17,840 --> 01:13:26,120
to true so to do that let's go to the

1683
01:13:22,679 --> 01:13:27,480
button and let's add

1684
01:13:26,120 --> 01:13:30,000
I'm just put it right here we're going

1685
01:13:27,480 --> 01:13:32,760
to say onclick so when you want to add

1686
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:36,120
an event it's going to be onclick you

1687
01:13:32,760 --> 01:13:38,639
have um uh onsubmit and it's going to be

1688
01:13:36,120 --> 01:13:41,280
camel case like this not like vanilla

1689
01:13:38,639 --> 01:13:44,280
JavaScript where it's all lowercase so

1690
01:13:41,280 --> 01:13:47,960
on click what do we want to do we want

1691
01:13:44,280 --> 01:13:50,120
to basically just call that set full uh

1692
01:13:47,960 --> 01:13:52,320
set show full description now you don't

1693
01:13:50,120 --> 01:13:54,120
want to just do set full description

1694
01:13:52,320 --> 01:13:55,719
here because that'll actually call it

1695
01:13:54,120 --> 01:13:59,000
without even clicking on it you want to

1696
01:13:55,719 --> 01:14:00,320
run a function and then call set show

1697
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:03,080
full

1698
01:14:00,320 --> 01:14:05,440
description now you could do this you

1699
01:14:03,080 --> 01:14:09,080
could say just set it to not whatever

1700
01:14:05,440 --> 01:14:11,040
set full description is okay because

1701
01:14:09,080 --> 01:14:13,560
when you call one of these

1702
01:14:11,040 --> 01:14:16,639
methods uh whether it's set show full

1703
01:14:13,560 --> 01:14:18,560
description or or Set uh I don't know

1704
01:14:16,639 --> 01:14:21,280
set anything whatever you you have for

1705
01:14:18,560 --> 01:14:22,760
your state it can take in a couple

1706
01:14:21,280 --> 01:14:25,320
different things it can take in a

1707
01:14:22,760 --> 01:14:27,520
straight value so in this case we're

1708
01:14:25,320 --> 01:14:30,560
just setting it to the opposite or it

1709
01:14:27,520 --> 01:14:33,239
can take in a function so if you pass a

1710
01:14:30,560 --> 01:14:35,679
function in you actually get here

1711
01:14:33,239 --> 01:14:38,560
whatever the previous state is and you

1712
01:14:35,679 --> 01:14:41,320
can call this whatever preve preve state

1713
01:14:38,560 --> 01:14:44,639
and what we want to do is then set it to

1714
01:14:41,320 --> 01:14:47,000
the opposite of whatever the preve state

1715
01:14:44,639 --> 01:14:50,000
is so if it's true set it to false if

1716
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:51,719
it's false set it to True um because you

1717
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:53,840
you can do it the the way I just showed

1718
01:14:51,719 --> 01:14:55,520
you just passing in the not set full

1719
01:14:53,840 --> 01:14:57,679
description but you can run into some

1720
01:14:55,520 --> 01:14:59,480
issues so this is a a better way of

1721
01:14:57,679 --> 01:15:01,719
doing it passing in the function getting

1722
01:14:59,480 --> 01:15:03,560
the previous state and then setting it

1723
01:15:01,719 --> 01:15:05,920
to whatever the opposite of that

1724
01:15:03,560 --> 01:15:07,480
previous state so we'll save that and

1725
01:15:05,920 --> 01:15:11,360
then let's come over here let's click

1726
01:15:07,480 --> 01:15:13,280
more and now we see the whole thing and

1727
01:15:11,360 --> 01:15:15,080
of course it's only the component where

1728
01:15:13,280 --> 01:15:18,080
that we click that we're talking about

1729
01:15:15,080 --> 01:15:20,719
okay these ones stay the same if I click

1730
01:15:18,080 --> 01:15:24,239
less then it'll show

1731
01:15:20,719 --> 01:15:26,040
less all right so this is I know we

1732
01:15:24,239 --> 01:15:28,360
don't have a lot of this type of stuff

1733
01:15:26,040 --> 01:15:29,960
in this project but that's the beauty of

1734
01:15:28,360 --> 01:15:32,480
using a frontend framework is the

1735
01:15:29,960 --> 01:15:34,800
ability to add this this kind of dynamic

1736
01:15:32,480 --> 01:15:36,880
stuff okay and you can picture using

1737
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:40,120
this for like a modal you have the open

1738
01:15:36,880 --> 01:15:43,320
and close State um if you have a a menu

1739
01:15:40,120 --> 01:15:46,679
a hamburger menu you have maybe menu you

1740
01:15:43,320 --> 01:15:49,120
could have menu open like right here you

1741
01:15:46,679 --> 01:15:52,440
could have menu open and set menu open

1742
01:15:49,120 --> 01:15:54,639
or something like that so um hopefully

1743
01:15:52,440 --> 01:15:57,520
this gives you just kind of a a good

1744
01:15:54,639 --> 01:16:00,040
picture of of what component state is

1745
01:15:57,520 --> 01:16:03,960
and what you can do with it now we're

1746
01:16:00,040 --> 01:16:05,760
close to our homepage being done so

1747
01:16:03,960 --> 01:16:07,719
let's take care of the icon because

1748
01:16:05,760 --> 01:16:10,000
right now we have that in our job

1749
01:16:07,719 --> 01:16:12,239
listing component we have that it tag

1750
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:15,280
which isn't showing anything because we

1751
01:16:12,239 --> 01:16:17,159
don't have the font awesome CDN but I

1752
01:16:15,280 --> 01:16:19,600
don't want to use the CDN I want to use

1753
01:16:17,159 --> 01:16:21,280
a separate package for that so this will

1754
01:16:19,600 --> 01:16:23,960
kind of give you a little bit of

1755
01:16:21,280 --> 01:16:25,960
experience in using additional packages

1756
01:16:23,960 --> 01:16:28,320
so I'm going to go to my terminal here

1757
01:16:25,960 --> 01:16:32,000
the one that's not running the server

1758
01:16:28,320 --> 01:16:35,239
and we're going to say npm install react

1759
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:37,440
Das icons and this will allow you to

1760
01:16:35,239 --> 01:16:39,560
work with not only font awesome but

1761
01:16:37,440 --> 01:16:42,040
material icons and some of the other

1762
01:16:39,560 --> 01:16:43,679
packages as well so now that we have

1763
01:16:42,040 --> 01:16:46,600
that installed we can go to any

1764
01:16:43,679 --> 01:16:47,440
component we want so in job listing

1765
01:16:46,600 --> 01:16:49,960
let's

1766
01:16:47,440 --> 01:16:53,400
import and we can get

1767
01:16:49,960 --> 01:16:55,520
from react icons but since we're using

1768
01:16:53,400 --> 01:16:58,679
font awesome it's going to be SL

1769
01:16:55,520 --> 01:17:00,840
fa and then there's a bunch of basically

1770
01:16:58,679 --> 01:17:02,760
all the font awesome icons that are

1771
01:17:00,840 --> 01:17:06,480
available here and they all start with

1772
01:17:02,760 --> 01:17:09,000
fa and you can see here there's just

1773
01:17:06,480 --> 01:17:12,760
tons of icons so the one that I want is

1774
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:15,360
called map marker this one right here

1775
01:17:12,760 --> 01:17:19,480
and then what we can do is go down to

1776
01:17:15,360 --> 01:17:21,440
where that it tag is now I still want uh

1777
01:17:19,480 --> 01:17:24,960
actually I'll just read the classes but

1778
01:17:21,440 --> 01:17:27,239
let's let's replace this it tag with fa

1779
01:17:24,960 --> 01:17:31,040
a map marker which is a component so

1780
01:17:27,239 --> 01:17:33,920
basically the icon itself is a component

1781
01:17:31,040 --> 01:17:36,639
and I'm just going to add some classes

1782
01:17:33,920 --> 01:17:41,159
to this I want it to be in line side by

1783
01:17:36,639 --> 01:17:43,920
side with the location text LG and then

1784
01:17:41,159 --> 01:17:46,120
a little margin bottom so let's save

1785
01:17:43,920 --> 01:17:48,679
that and now you can see we have our

1786
01:17:46,120 --> 01:17:51,199
little icon let's actually put some

1787
01:17:48,679 --> 01:17:54,159
margin on the right as well we'll say

1788
01:17:51,199 --> 01:17:56,280
mr1 push that over a little bit so now

1789
01:17:54,159 --> 01:17:58,760
anywhere you want icons you can bring it

1790
01:17:56,280 --> 01:18:01,719
in from react

1791
01:17:58,760 --> 01:18:04,440
icons so I think now we're to the point

1792
01:18:01,719 --> 01:18:07,000
where we want to start to add additional

1793
01:18:04,440 --> 01:18:10,360
pages right we want the jobs page the ad

1794
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:13,040
job page so we can't do that with just

1795
01:18:10,360 --> 01:18:15,280
react so this is this is where you know

1796
01:18:13,040 --> 01:18:18,239
what I talked about earlier a library

1797
01:18:15,280 --> 01:18:21,719
versus a framework being a library it

1798
01:18:18,239 --> 01:18:23,719
doesn't have a way to add separate pages

1799
01:18:21,719 --> 01:18:26,400
so we're going to use react router which

1800
01:18:23,719 --> 01:18:29,600
is the basically the official router for

1801
01:18:26,400 --> 01:18:32,600
react but it is a separate package so we

1802
01:18:29,600 --> 01:18:35,600
need to install it so let's go

1803
01:18:32,600 --> 01:18:37,520
to um let's go to the terminal again and

1804
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:40,440
we're going to npm install and the name

1805
01:18:37,520 --> 01:18:43,960
of this package is react router

1806
01:18:40,440 --> 01:18:46,880
ddom okay make sure you add the dashd so

1807
01:18:43,960 --> 01:18:46,880
we're going to install

1808
01:18:48,360 --> 01:18:55,120
that and the the way that you set this

1809
01:18:51,639 --> 01:18:56,760
up has changed a lot over time um in

1810
01:18:55,120 --> 01:18:59,280
fact there's been at least two times

1811
01:18:56,760 --> 01:19:02,000
where I've created a react course and

1812
01:18:59,280 --> 01:19:05,159
then not too long later they changed it

1813
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:07,600
up on how to use this um and it can be a

1814
01:19:05,159 --> 01:19:09,600
little the the boiler plate can be a

1815
01:19:07,600 --> 01:19:13,639
little overwhelming for beginners so

1816
01:19:09,600 --> 01:19:15,960
just bear with me so we're going to put

1817
01:19:13,639 --> 01:19:18,440
all the routing stuff in the the main

1818
01:19:15,960 --> 01:19:21,600
app file so in the app

1819
01:19:18,440 --> 01:19:25,679
jsx and react router is it's actually a

1820
01:19:21,600 --> 01:19:27,639
pretty big package um it's it's

1821
01:19:25,679 --> 01:19:29,400
buil the remix framework which is a

1822
01:19:27,639 --> 01:19:32,239
server side rendering framework for

1823
01:19:29,400 --> 01:19:34,760
react it's built on top of react router

1824
01:19:32,239 --> 01:19:36,159
so there's a lot that you can do um we

1825
01:19:34,760 --> 01:19:39,199
we're going to get into some stuff like

1826
01:19:36,159 --> 01:19:41,440
data loaders that react router offers

1827
01:19:39,199 --> 01:19:43,320
we're going to do that later on so just

1828
01:19:41,440 --> 01:19:44,760
just be aware that it is there's a lot

1829
01:19:43,320 --> 01:19:47,360
to it and it can be a little

1830
01:19:44,760 --> 01:19:49,400
overwhelming but I'm going to show you

1831
01:19:47,360 --> 01:19:51,679
exactly how to create routes and you

1832
01:19:49,400 --> 01:19:55,560
know so you can have multiple pages so

1833
01:19:51,679 --> 01:19:59,000
let's import a few things from react

1834
01:19:55,560 --> 01:20:01,520
router Dom again make sure you use the

1835
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:03,920
dash Dom at the end so we're going to

1836
01:20:01,520 --> 01:20:07,880
bring in the route component we're going

1837
01:20:03,920 --> 01:20:10,679
to bring in create browser router

1838
01:20:07,880 --> 01:20:12,480
create uh it's called create

1839
01:20:10,679 --> 01:20:17,520
routes

1840
01:20:12,480 --> 01:20:19,639
from elements and also the router

1841
01:20:17,520 --> 01:20:20,719
provider okay so we want to bring in

1842
01:20:19,639 --> 01:20:23,360
those

1843
01:20:20,719 --> 01:20:26,199
things now the way that this will work

1844
01:20:23,360 --> 01:20:28,600
is above the the return in the main app

1845
01:20:26,199 --> 01:20:31,360
component we're going to create a

1846
01:20:28,600 --> 01:20:34,520
variable called router and we're going

1847
01:20:31,360 --> 01:20:36,679
to set that to create browser router

1848
01:20:34,520 --> 01:20:39,520
which does just that it'll create our

1849
01:20:36,679 --> 01:20:42,280
router and inside that we're going to

1850
01:20:39,520 --> 01:20:45,440
then use create routes from

1851
01:20:42,280 --> 01:20:48,800
elements and inside that is where we can

1852
01:20:45,440 --> 01:20:53,120
use our route component so we're going

1853
01:20:48,800 --> 01:20:54,920
to put in route and then you can put in

1854
01:20:53,120 --> 01:20:56,760
a path here but this is going to be for

1855
01:20:54,920 --> 01:20:59,679
the homepage so we'll we can actually

1856
01:20:56,760 --> 01:21:04,239
just put an index and then you can have

1857
01:20:59,679 --> 01:21:07,600
an element represent that route so for

1858
01:21:04,239 --> 01:21:10,639
now I'll just I'm just going to put

1859
01:21:07,600 --> 01:21:13,760
in in H1 because you can do anything

1860
01:21:10,639 --> 01:21:15,480
just to show you we'll just say my app

1861
01:21:13,760 --> 01:21:18,080
okay now this isn't going to do anything

1862
01:21:15,480 --> 01:21:20,560
just yet because we haven't um we

1863
01:21:18,080 --> 01:21:22,840
haven't implemented the provider okay

1864
01:21:20,560 --> 01:21:26,199
the provider is what provides the router

1865
01:21:22,840 --> 01:21:28,560
and that's going to go down here so

1866
01:21:26,199 --> 01:21:31,880
we're actually going to change this up

1867
01:21:28,560 --> 01:21:33,679
and not embed these components in here

1868
01:21:31,880 --> 01:21:36,560
cuz we're going to have separate pages

1869
01:21:33,679 --> 01:21:39,480
so we can actually um get rid of all

1870
01:21:36,560 --> 01:21:42,520
this and all we're going to return is

1871
01:21:39,480 --> 01:21:45,400
going to be the router provider so we're

1872
01:21:42,520 --> 01:21:46,800
going to say router provider and don't

1873
01:21:45,400 --> 01:21:48,159
worry we're still going to use those

1874
01:21:46,800 --> 01:21:50,360
components they're just going to be used

1875
01:21:48,159 --> 01:21:52,719
in a different way so let's say router

1876
01:21:50,360 --> 01:21:55,760
provider and then that'll take in the

1877
01:21:52,719 --> 01:21:58,080
router that we just created

1878
01:21:55,760 --> 01:22:00,360
so if I save that now you can see we

1879
01:21:58,080 --> 01:22:04,199
have my app and that pertains to the

1880
01:22:00,360 --> 01:22:06,080
homepage row now if I were to set this

1881
01:22:04,199 --> 01:22:10,360
let's say path

1882
01:22:06,080 --> 01:22:12,040
equals slash about right and then I go

1883
01:22:10,360 --> 01:22:14,440
to

1884
01:22:12,040 --> 01:22:16,920
slab then that's going to show that

1885
01:22:14,440 --> 01:22:20,840
element okay so this does exactly what

1886
01:22:16,920 --> 01:22:23,280
it says it creates a route with a path

1887
01:22:20,840 --> 01:22:26,040
and it creates that from an element

1888
01:22:23,280 --> 01:22:30,760
which in this case is a H 1 now I want

1889
01:22:26,040 --> 01:22:34,880
to show a page for my for my index let's

1890
01:22:30,760 --> 01:22:37,719
put that back to index so what what I do

1891
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:39,719
is create a separate folder because your

1892
01:22:37,719 --> 01:22:41,719
your pages are components they're still

1893
01:22:39,719 --> 01:22:43,639
react components but I don't want to put

1894
01:22:41,719 --> 01:22:46,679
them in the same folder as the my

1895
01:22:43,639 --> 01:22:49,239
regular UI components so let's create a

1896
01:22:46,679 --> 01:22:51,760
a folder called Pages you might see it

1897
01:22:49,239 --> 01:22:53,239
called screens sometimes um but we're

1898
01:22:51,760 --> 01:22:57,560
going to call it pages and then we're

1899
01:22:53,239 --> 01:22:59,800
going to create a home page. jsx file

1900
01:22:57,560 --> 01:23:01,360
and just like a regular react component

1901
01:22:59,800 --> 01:23:04,080
we'll do

1902
01:23:01,360 --> 01:23:07,320
rafc and on the

1903
01:23:04,080 --> 01:23:09,719
homepage we want to bring in actually

1904
01:23:07,320 --> 01:23:11,040
let's just save this for now and go back

1905
01:23:09,719 --> 01:23:14,239
to app

1906
01:23:11,040 --> 01:23:16,000
jsx and we no longer need to bring this

1907
01:23:14,239 --> 01:23:18,280
stuff in here because we're not using it

1908
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:20,159
in our main app file so we can get rid

1909
01:23:18,280 --> 01:23:22,280
of that but we do want to bring in our

1910
01:23:20,159 --> 01:23:24,080
pages that we're going to use so we'll

1911
01:23:22,280 --> 01:23:26,960
bring in homepage make sure it's from

1912
01:23:24,080 --> 01:23:30,800
pages and not components and then here

1913
01:23:26,960 --> 01:23:33,880
we're going to render the

1914
01:23:30,800 --> 01:23:36,800
homepage okay so now if I save that and

1915
01:23:33,880 --> 01:23:39,040
we go uh about doesn't exist and I'll

1916
01:23:36,800 --> 01:23:40,760
show you how we can create a custom 404

1917
01:23:39,040 --> 01:23:43,639
page as well but if we go to the

1918
01:23:40,760 --> 01:23:47,000
homepage then we see the text

1919
01:23:43,639 --> 01:23:48,520
homepage okay now in the homepage this

1920
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:52,320
is where I want to bring

1921
01:23:48,520 --> 01:23:54,199
in um not the navbar because the Navar I

1922
01:23:52,320 --> 01:23:55,679
want to show on all pages and we we

1923
01:23:54,199 --> 01:23:57,159
don't want to have to bring it into

1924
01:23:55,679 --> 01:24:00,000
every single page so we're going to

1925
01:23:57,159 --> 01:24:02,199
create something called a layout um but

1926
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:04,880
let's say the hero component for example

1927
01:24:02,199 --> 01:24:08,920
that I only want on the homepage so that

1928
01:24:04,880 --> 01:24:12,000
I would import let's say import

1929
01:24:08,920 --> 01:24:14,760
hero from and then let's see we're going

1930
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:15,639
to go up one level into components and

1931
01:24:14,760 --> 01:24:21,560
then

1932
01:24:15,639 --> 01:24:21,560
hero and then let's uh we'll make this a

1933
01:24:22,199 --> 01:24:28,320
fragment and then we'll put our hero

1934
01:24:25,560 --> 01:24:30,120
component save that and now the hero

1935
01:24:28,320 --> 01:24:32,719
component

1936
01:24:30,120 --> 01:24:35,840
shows all right

1937
01:24:32,719 --> 01:24:37,600
now like I said for the navbar and

1938
01:24:35,840 --> 01:24:39,440
things like Footers that's stuff you

1939
01:24:37,600 --> 01:24:42,040
want to show on every page so this is

1940
01:24:39,440 --> 01:24:44,760
where layouts come in so we're going to

1941
01:24:42,040 --> 01:24:47,440
create uh another folder in the source

1942
01:24:44,760 --> 01:24:49,960
folder called layouts and you can have

1943
01:24:47,440 --> 01:24:51,639
multiple layouts this particular project

1944
01:24:49,960 --> 01:24:54,440
will only have one but you can have

1945
01:24:51,639 --> 01:24:57,840
multiple but let's call this main layout

1946
01:24:54,440 --> 01:25:00,280
out. jsx and again this will be a react

1947
01:24:57,840 --> 01:25:01,880
component now before we do anything here

1948
01:25:00,280 --> 01:25:04,440
I just want to show you how to actually

1949
01:25:01,880 --> 01:25:08,600
use the layout so we can bring it into

1950
01:25:04,440 --> 01:25:11,480
our main app jsx let's say import main

1951
01:25:08,600 --> 01:25:15,239
layout and then what we need to do is

1952
01:25:11,480 --> 01:25:19,679
just create a parent route to the rest

1953
01:25:15,239 --> 01:25:21,239
of our routes so let's go right here and

1954
01:25:19,679 --> 01:25:25,080
say

1955
01:25:21,239 --> 01:25:27,239
route and say path and set that to to

1956
01:25:25,080 --> 01:25:31,199
slash and

1957
01:25:27,239 --> 01:25:34,560
then um the element is going to be set

1958
01:25:31,199 --> 01:25:36,840
to the main

1959
01:25:34,560 --> 01:25:40,159
layout okay and then we're going to

1960
01:25:36,840 --> 01:25:41,840
surround this uh this parentheses should

1961
01:25:40,159 --> 01:25:44,880
be here and then we're going to move

1962
01:25:41,840 --> 01:25:47,480
that in here okay so

1963
01:25:44,880 --> 01:25:50,119
basically if I save that you'll see main

1964
01:25:47,480 --> 01:25:52,040
layout so now this is being applied we

1965
01:25:50,119 --> 01:25:53,880
don't see the homepage anymore and I'll

1966
01:25:52,040 --> 01:25:55,920
I'll show you how we can get that back

1967
01:25:53,880 --> 01:25:58,360
in a second second but basically

1968
01:25:55,920 --> 01:26:00,480
anything any routes we put in here are

1969
01:25:58,360 --> 01:26:03,840
then going to use this

1970
01:26:00,480 --> 01:26:06,880
layout so in the main layout whatever

1971
01:26:03,840 --> 01:26:09,920
route you're on that that content that

1972
01:26:06,880 --> 01:26:12,920
page is going to come through the outlet

1973
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:16,440
so we're going to import outlet from

1974
01:26:12,920 --> 01:26:19,239
react router Dom and then down here

1975
01:26:16,440 --> 01:26:21,880
let's make that just a fragment and then

1976
01:26:19,239 --> 01:26:23,080
get rid of the text and we want to

1977
01:26:21,880 --> 01:26:26,639
Output

1978
01:26:23,080 --> 01:26:29,560
here um we want to say Outlet okay it's

1979
01:26:26,639 --> 01:26:32,520
it's an actual component now if I save

1980
01:26:29,560 --> 01:26:33,800
that we're seeing the the hero again

1981
01:26:32,520 --> 01:26:36,560
because we're on the

1982
01:26:33,800 --> 01:26:39,560
homepage right we have no other routes

1983
01:26:36,560 --> 01:26:40,960
so if I were to go to slab we're just

1984
01:26:39,560 --> 01:26:44,080
going to see this

1985
01:26:40,960 --> 01:26:46,840
404 okay but uh let's reload that that

1986
01:26:44,080 --> 01:26:49,440
was just cached um but now we're

1987
01:26:46,840 --> 01:26:52,000
seeing whatever whatever the content of

1988
01:26:49,440 --> 01:26:54,520
the page r on now I want the navbar to

1989
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:56,719
show on every page so here here we're

1990
01:26:54,520 --> 01:26:59,119
going to bring in the

1991
01:26:56,719 --> 01:27:02,320
navbar say navbar that's going to be

1992
01:26:59,119 --> 01:27:05,199
from dot do SL

1993
01:27:02,320 --> 01:27:07,800
components navbar and then let's put

1994
01:27:05,199 --> 01:27:09,719
that above the

1995
01:27:07,800 --> 01:27:12,600
outlet

1996
01:27:09,719 --> 01:27:14,639
so and there we go so now any page we're

1997
01:27:12,600 --> 01:27:17,880
on is going to have the

1998
01:27:14,639 --> 01:27:20,400
navbar and of course this this is much

1999
01:27:17,880 --> 01:27:23,520
better than doing you know the vanilla

2000
01:27:20,400 --> 01:27:26,159
way of having separate HTML Pages where

2001
01:27:23,520 --> 01:27:29,400
you have your separate header or your

2002
01:27:26,159 --> 01:27:31,880
separate navbar code HTML on every

2003
01:27:29,400 --> 01:27:34,239
page so now that we've done that let's

2004
01:27:31,880 --> 01:27:35,840
see the next thing let's finish up the

2005
01:27:34,239 --> 01:27:37,840
homepage basically we're just going to

2006
01:27:35,840 --> 01:27:40,679
bring in the rest of our components that

2007
01:27:37,840 --> 01:27:43,040
we had on the main in the main app file

2008
01:27:40,679 --> 01:27:44,840
so what else we have the hero we have

2009
01:27:43,040 --> 01:27:49,560
the home

2010
01:27:44,840 --> 01:27:52,639
cards so going to bring that in from

2011
01:27:49,560 --> 01:27:56,119
components slome cards and we'll put

2012
01:27:52,639 --> 01:27:56,119
that right here

2013
01:27:56,719 --> 01:28:05,239
okay so now those are showing

2014
01:27:59,040 --> 01:28:05,239
there uh what else do we need the job

2015
01:28:06,840 --> 01:28:13,960
listings uh

2016
01:28:09,920 --> 01:28:13,960
import job listings

2017
01:28:14,239 --> 01:28:20,360
plural uh dot dot slash

2018
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:23,119
components job

2019
01:28:20,360 --> 01:28:24,840
listings put that

2020
01:28:23,119 --> 01:28:26,520
here

2021
01:28:24,840 --> 01:28:29,520
so instead of just putting the stuff in

2022
01:28:26,520 --> 01:28:31,960
the main app component we're putting it

2023
01:28:29,520 --> 01:28:31,960
in the

2024
01:28:34,480 --> 01:28:38,239
homepage okay then the last thing I

2025
01:28:36,719 --> 01:28:41,360
think was the view

2026
01:28:38,239 --> 01:28:44,360
all so

2027
01:28:41,360 --> 01:28:47,960
view was it view all

2028
01:28:44,360 --> 01:28:47,960
listings view all

2029
01:28:53,040 --> 01:28:57,520
jobs all right we'll put that

2030
01:29:00,239 --> 01:29:04,679
here and there we go so we have this

2031
01:29:02,719 --> 01:29:06,000
which goes to SL jobs which doesn't

2032
01:29:04,679 --> 01:29:08,639
exist

2033
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:11,480
yet so let's do that next let's create

2034
01:29:08,639 --> 01:29:13,400
the jobs page in the jobs route so

2035
01:29:11,480 --> 01:29:15,159
that's kind of the workflow from now on

2036
01:29:13,400 --> 01:29:17,840
is you create a new page and then you go

2037
01:29:15,159 --> 01:29:21,560
to the app file and add the route so

2038
01:29:17,840 --> 01:29:23,040
let's create a file in Pages called jobs

2039
01:29:21,560 --> 01:29:26,040
page.

2040
01:29:23,040 --> 01:29:26,040
jsx

2041
01:29:31,040 --> 01:29:36,760
we'll say ra fce jobs page just save

2042
01:29:35,080 --> 01:29:40,119
that for now and then let's add the

2043
01:29:36,760 --> 01:29:43,920
route we can close this other stuff up

2044
01:29:40,119 --> 01:29:45,440
let's add the route into app jsx so we

2045
01:29:43,920 --> 01:29:48,880
need to bring

2046
01:29:45,440 --> 01:29:50,320
in jobs page and then we can just copy

2047
01:29:48,880 --> 01:29:53,159
this down except now we're going to

2048
01:29:50,320 --> 01:29:56,840
change index to path and we're going to

2049
01:29:53,159 --> 01:29:56,840
set that to slash

2050
01:29:57,560 --> 01:30:07,000
jobs and change this the element to jobs

2051
01:30:02,800 --> 01:30:07,000
page so now if we click on

2052
01:30:07,400 --> 01:30:12,880
jobs uh oh this is still going to jobs

2053
01:30:10,719 --> 01:30:14,400
HTML and that's another thing I want to

2054
01:30:12,880 --> 01:30:16,760
get to is links because it works a

2055
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:20,119
little bit different um we don't use a

2056
01:30:16,760 --> 01:30:22,080
tags we use the link tag so uh but we

2057
01:30:20,119 --> 01:30:24,199
can use the a tag it will work so I just

2058
01:30:22,080 --> 01:30:25,119
want to real quick go into the nav box

2059
01:30:24,199 --> 01:30:28,239
so

2060
01:30:25,119 --> 01:30:32,480
components navbar and just

2061
01:30:28,239 --> 01:30:36,320
change let's see this index HTML change

2062
01:30:32,480 --> 01:30:39,679
that to slash change this to slash jobs

2063
01:30:36,320 --> 01:30:42,119
and change this to slash add job all

2064
01:30:39,679 --> 01:30:45,119
right so now if I click jobs it takes me

2065
01:30:42,119 --> 01:30:48,119
to the jobs page right also this button

2066
01:30:45,119 --> 01:30:51,639
down here goes to SL jobs as

2067
01:30:48,119 --> 01:30:53,480
well so now let's get into the link tag

2068
01:30:51,639 --> 01:30:56,360
because we don't want to use a tags

2069
01:30:53,480 --> 01:31:00,920
because it does a complete page refresh

2070
01:30:56,360 --> 01:31:03,639
okay so if I click uh wait so if I click

2071
01:31:00,920 --> 01:31:07,000
that if you look up here in the in the

2072
01:31:03,639 --> 01:31:10,199
tab it shows the little uh little loader

2073
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:13,960
real quick right so by using the link

2074
01:31:10,199 --> 01:31:17,960
tag it doesn't do an actual refresh so

2075
01:31:13,960 --> 01:31:21,679
in the navbar let's

2076
01:31:17,960 --> 01:31:23,880
import link uh actually it's going to be

2077
01:31:21,679 --> 01:31:24,840
in curly braces so we want to import

2078
01:31:23,880 --> 01:31:26,480
Port

2079
01:31:24,840 --> 01:31:29,679
link

2080
01:31:26,480 --> 01:31:32,400
from react router Dom and then we're

2081
01:31:29,679 --> 01:31:34,360
going to change any a tag we have such

2082
01:31:32,400 --> 01:31:36,040
as this one which goes around the logo

2083
01:31:34,360 --> 01:31:40,320
we're going to change it to

2084
01:31:36,040 --> 01:31:43,040
link and then the href we're actually

2085
01:31:40,320 --> 01:31:45,800
going to change it to two and then let's

2086
01:31:43,040 --> 01:31:48,639
make this just slash which is the

2087
01:31:45,800 --> 01:31:52,119
homepage all right so that one and then

2088
01:31:48,639 --> 01:31:55,840
we have this one change that to link

2089
01:31:52,119 --> 01:31:55,840
change this to two

2090
01:31:56,400 --> 01:32:01,199
same thing here link make sure the

2091
01:31:58,520 --> 01:32:03,400
ending tag changes as

2092
01:32:01,199 --> 01:32:07,000
well

2093
01:32:03,400 --> 01:32:07,000
two and this

2094
01:32:09,080 --> 01:32:13,880
one all right so now let's save that and

2095
01:32:11,760 --> 01:32:15,639
now I'm just going to reload this page

2096
01:32:13,880 --> 01:32:19,520
if I click there you can see it goes to

2097
01:32:15,639 --> 01:32:22,239
the home and as I as I link and change

2098
01:32:19,520 --> 01:32:24,400
Pages you see there's no refresh loader

2099
01:32:22,239 --> 01:32:26,440
thing in the in the title it's it's very

2100
01:32:24,400 --> 01:32:27,600
fast right because it's all it's all on

2101
01:32:26,440 --> 01:32:30,840
the

2102
01:32:27,600 --> 01:32:33,119
client and we want to change the link

2103
01:32:30,840 --> 01:32:36,719
down here and the links for all these

2104
01:32:33,119 --> 01:32:41,199
buttons to use the link tag so let's go

2105
01:32:36,719 --> 01:32:46,400
to let's see what's next we'll go to the

2106
01:32:41,199 --> 01:32:48,880
um where is it home cards yeah this home

2107
01:32:46,400 --> 01:32:51,560
cards change that actually we need to

2108
01:32:48,880 --> 01:32:52,840
bring it in so up top of Home cards

2109
01:32:51,560 --> 01:32:55,840
let's

2110
01:32:52,840 --> 01:32:55,840
import

2111
01:32:58,239 --> 01:33:04,440
link okay and then this is going to be

2112
01:33:01,400 --> 01:33:07,199
two and it's going to go to slash

2113
01:33:04,440 --> 01:33:11,639
jobs and then this

2114
01:33:07,199 --> 01:33:14,920
one the add job let's change that to

2115
01:33:11,639 --> 01:33:18,440
link change that to two and change that

2116
01:33:14,920 --> 01:33:21,600
to just slash add job all right so that

2117
01:33:18,440 --> 01:33:25,560
should work this does that route doesn't

2118
01:33:21,600 --> 01:33:27,880
exist yet but it will then we have the

2119
01:33:25,560 --> 01:33:32,639
the job listing component so let's go

2120
01:33:27,880 --> 01:33:32,639
into that job listing and let's bring

2121
01:33:32,760 --> 01:33:40,560
in

2122
01:33:34,960 --> 01:33:43,760
link and then the a tag which is right

2123
01:33:40,560 --> 01:33:47,280
here link

2124
01:33:43,760 --> 01:33:49,840
to okay and

2125
01:33:47,280 --> 01:33:52,719
then is that it I think yeah I think

2126
01:33:49,840 --> 01:33:57,119
that's it did we do this one no view all

2127
01:33:52,719 --> 01:33:57,119
jobs now we want to do that as

2128
01:34:01,119 --> 01:34:05,880
well okay and then change

2129
01:34:05,960 --> 01:34:09,360
this and

2130
01:34:10,320 --> 01:34:15,560
this all right cool now a couple things

2131
01:34:13,280 --> 01:34:17,280
I want to do before we get to the jobs

2132
01:34:15,560 --> 01:34:19,639
page so one thing I want to have a

2133
01:34:17,280 --> 01:34:22,639
custom 404 cuz obviously this doesn't

2134
01:34:19,639 --> 01:34:26,880
look very good so what we'll do is go

2135
01:34:22,639 --> 01:34:29,840
into the theme files and I believe I

2136
01:34:26,880 --> 01:34:33,040

2138
01:34:33,040 --> 01:34:40,080
section so I'm going to grab that and

2139
01:34:36,320 --> 01:34:43,080
then let's create a new page so in Pages

2140
01:34:40,080 --> 01:34:46,760
we'll say not found

2141
01:34:43,080 --> 01:34:49,600
page jsx and

2142
01:34:46,760 --> 01:34:52,239
rafc and then I'm just going to paste in

2143
01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:54,440
that section be sure to change all the

2144
01:34:52,239 --> 01:34:56,400
instances of class

2145
01:34:54,440 --> 01:34:59,440
to class

2146
01:34:56,400 --> 01:35:03,920
name and let's see we're going to bring

2147
01:34:59,440 --> 01:35:07,760
in link into this file as well so let's

2148
01:35:03,920 --> 01:35:12,159
import link and then change this a tag

2149
01:35:07,760 --> 01:35:17,639
to link and change the HRA to

2150
01:35:12,159 --> 01:35:17,639
two and change this to just slash just

2151
01:35:19,719 --> 01:35:26,280
slash uh why is

2152
01:35:22,639 --> 01:35:29,159
this all right there we go so now let's

2153
01:35:26,280 --> 01:35:31,320
go to actually do we have an icon yeah

2154
01:35:29,159 --> 01:35:33,320
we do have an icon here so I'm also

2155
01:35:31,320 --> 01:35:35,159
going to bring

2156
01:35:33,320 --> 01:35:39,880
in

2157
01:35:35,159 --> 01:35:43,520
FA exclamation triangle from react

2158
01:35:39,880 --> 01:35:46,600
icons and then let's replace this this

2159
01:35:43,520 --> 01:35:51,600
it tag right

2160
01:35:46,600 --> 01:35:51,600
here um I'm just going to copy these

2161
01:35:51,639 --> 01:35:56,520
classes yeah and then we'll get rid of

2162
01:35:53,719 --> 01:36:00,440
the it tag and then let's put in FA

2163
01:35:56,520 --> 01:36:02,639
exclamation triangle and then class name

2164
01:36:00,440 --> 01:36:04,600
paste in we're going to have text

2165
01:36:02,639 --> 01:36:07,560
yellow and

2166
01:36:04,600 --> 01:36:08,800
then um actually we don't need this fa

2167
01:36:07,560 --> 01:36:13,440
class right here we're going to get rid

2168
01:36:08,800 --> 01:36:16,840
of that let's add text-

2169
01:36:13,440 --> 01:36:18,480
6xl okay now to make this show on pages

2170
01:36:16,840 --> 01:36:22,080
that aren't found we're going to go back

2171
01:36:18,480 --> 01:36:25,440
to the main app component and let's

2172
01:36:22,080 --> 01:36:26,560
import the not found page and then what

2173
01:36:25,440 --> 01:36:29,960
we can

2174
01:36:26,560 --> 01:36:33,840
do is add a new route actually we'll

2175
01:36:29,960 --> 01:36:35,040
just copy that down and we're going to

2176
01:36:33,840 --> 01:36:39,719
set this

2177
01:36:35,040 --> 01:36:41,360
to the not found page and for the for

2178
01:36:39,719 --> 01:36:43,840
the path we're just going to put in an

2179
01:36:41,360 --> 01:36:47,480
asterisk so this should be like a

2180
01:36:43,840 --> 01:36:51,239
catchall so home should work jobs works

2181
01:36:47,480 --> 01:36:52,960
if I go to add job we get 404 not found

2182
01:36:51,239 --> 01:36:54,840
okay so any page that's not found you're

2183
01:36:52,960 --> 01:36:57,239
going to get that which looks a lot

2184
01:36:54,840 --> 01:36:59,840
better now the next thing I want to do

2185
01:36:57,239 --> 01:37:02,080
is is the active link so right now you

2186
01:36:59,840 --> 01:37:06,360
can see if I go to jobs the home is

2187
01:37:02,080 --> 01:37:06,360
still active so if we open up the

2188
01:37:06,920 --> 01:37:13,360
navbar right here you'll see that the

2189
01:37:09,520 --> 01:37:15,639
home link has a class of BG black so

2190
01:37:13,360 --> 01:37:19,040
basically we want to show that BG black

2191
01:37:15,639 --> 01:37:21,000
on whatever the the active Pages now we

2192
01:37:19,040 --> 01:37:23,560
can do that by bringing in something

2193
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:25,800
called nav link instead of Link which

2194
01:37:23,560 --> 01:37:30,199
which works it works in a very similar

2195
01:37:25,800 --> 01:37:33,920
way except it adds a class to the active

2196
01:37:30,199 --> 01:37:37,280
link and we can change all the instances

2197
01:37:33,920 --> 01:37:42,360
of link to nav link and it'll work the

2198
01:37:37,280 --> 01:37:42,360
same way so right here

2199
01:37:44,199 --> 01:37:49,719
here here and then

2200
01:37:47,080 --> 01:37:54,040
here all right so if we do that then

2201
01:37:49,719 --> 01:37:55,480
this should still work the same way so

2202
01:37:54,040 --> 01:37:57,679
what we're going to do is go to the home

2203
01:37:55,480 --> 01:38:00,880
link which is right here and for the

2204
01:37:57,679 --> 01:38:03,760
class name let's just delete all this

2205
01:38:00,880 --> 01:38:08,159
for now and and put some curly braces in

2206
01:38:03,760 --> 01:38:12,480
here and what we can do is actually pass

2207
01:38:08,159 --> 01:38:14,679
in an arrow like this and then in these

2208
01:38:12,480 --> 01:38:18,000
parentheses we're going to pass in uh

2209
01:38:14,679 --> 01:38:20,639
some curly braces and then put is

2210
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:22,599
active and then we can test to so this

2211
01:38:20,639 --> 01:38:24,719
will be a true or false if the link is

2212
01:38:22,599 --> 01:38:27,920
active if we're on that that page then

2213
01:38:24,719 --> 01:38:30,480
this will be true so then for the class

2214
01:38:27,920 --> 01:38:33,239
name we'll have a turn area and we'll

2215
01:38:30,480 --> 01:38:36,560
say if is active so if this link or this

2216
01:38:33,239 --> 01:38:39,159
page is active then show a class else

2217
01:38:36,560 --> 01:38:41,639
should have another class and I'm going

2218
01:38:39,159 --> 01:38:44,320
to just copy all these right here and

2219
01:38:41,639 --> 01:38:46,880
I'm going to put that in the first one

2220
01:38:44,320 --> 01:38:51,719
but I'm also going to add in

2221
01:38:46,880 --> 01:38:54,440
here uh BG Das

2222
01:38:51,719 --> 01:38:56,040
black okay and then for the else this

2223
01:38:54,440 --> 01:38:57,679
one I'm just going to put it in without

2224
01:38:56,040 --> 01:39:00,920
the BG

2225
01:38:57,679 --> 01:39:02,760
black so now if I save that so you can

2226
01:39:00,920 --> 01:39:04,199
see it has a black background if I go to

2227
01:39:02,760 --> 01:39:06,599
jobs it

2228
01:39:04,199 --> 01:39:09,040
doesn't and we want to do that for all

2229
01:39:06,599 --> 01:39:11,760
of these so what we can do is just copy

2230
01:39:09,040 --> 01:39:14,760
the first nav

2231
01:39:11,760 --> 01:39:19,000
link actually you know a cleaner way to

2232
01:39:14,760 --> 01:39:21,360
do this would be um to put this in a in

2233
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:23,639
a function up here and then just add it

2234
01:39:21,360 --> 01:39:27,239
yeah why don't we do that that makes

2235
01:39:23,639 --> 01:39:30,960
more sense so let's grab the function so

2236
01:39:27,239 --> 01:39:31,920
this the parentheses and then the arrow

2237
01:39:30,960 --> 01:39:35,599
so

2238
01:39:31,920 --> 01:39:38,159
basically to this and let's cut it so

2239
01:39:35,599 --> 01:39:41,719
that all you have now oops so that all

2240
01:39:38,159 --> 01:39:41,719
you have now is just the curly

2241
01:39:41,800 --> 01:39:48,880
braces and then we'll go up

2242
01:39:45,239 --> 01:39:51,679
here and we want to go within the

2243
01:39:48,880 --> 01:39:55,599
component and let's say const we'll call

2244
01:39:51,679 --> 01:39:58,480
this link class and then set that and

2245
01:39:55,599 --> 01:39:58,480
then paste that

2246
01:39:58,560 --> 01:40:03,719
in okay so now what we can do is just

2247
01:40:01,239 --> 01:40:05,119
simply add for class name we can just

2248
01:40:03,719 --> 01:40:08,159
add link

2249
01:40:05,119 --> 01:40:11,440
class and we can do that for all of

2250
01:40:08,159 --> 01:40:13,480
these so we'll take that do it for that

2251
01:40:11,440 --> 01:40:17,000
one and for this

2252
01:40:13,480 --> 01:40:20,239
one and now if I go to jobs now that's

2253
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:22,320
highlighted Okay add job I mean it still

2254
01:40:20,239 --> 01:40:24,880
does the active link but it doesn't

2255
01:40:22,320 --> 01:40:27,639
exist

2256
01:40:24,880 --> 01:40:31,840
so you can see we make this you know

2257
01:40:27,639 --> 01:40:35,199
dynamic um just by using

2258
01:40:31,840 --> 01:40:36,800
navlink so let's do the job uh the jobs

2259
01:40:35,199 --> 01:40:39,719
page which is going to be really easy

2260
01:40:36,800 --> 01:40:44,080
because I want to reuse the job listings

2261
01:40:39,719 --> 01:40:47,960
component so let's um let's do this

2262
01:40:44,080 --> 01:40:50,520
let's go into jobs page and let's bring

2263
01:40:47,960 --> 01:40:53,040
in job

2264
01:40:50,520 --> 01:40:55,440
listings and then let's see I'm just

2265
01:40:53,040 --> 01:41:00,080
going to to make this a

2266
01:40:55,440 --> 01:41:02,199
section and give it a class name of BG

2267
01:41:00,080 --> 01:41:04,520
dblue

2268
01:41:02,199 --> 01:41:07,520
D50 and

2269
01:41:04,520 --> 01:41:09,880
PX4 and

2270
01:41:07,520 --> 01:41:13,199
py6 and then all I'm going to have in

2271
01:41:09,880 --> 01:41:15,119
here is the job listings component so

2272
01:41:13,199 --> 01:41:17,400
let's add

2273
01:41:15,119 --> 01:41:21,040
that okay

2274
01:41:17,400 --> 01:41:23,040
so the issue here is that we're only

2275
01:41:21,040 --> 01:41:26,760
seeing three and we want to show all of

2276
01:41:23,040 --> 01:41:30,400
the listings so let's do this let's pass

2277
01:41:26,760 --> 01:41:32,639
in a prop into job listings D structure

2278
01:41:30,400 --> 01:41:37,400
and it'll be called is home and we'll

2279
01:41:32,639 --> 01:41:40,639
set it to false by default and then

2280
01:41:37,400 --> 01:41:44,119
let's let's change

2281
01:41:40,639 --> 01:41:48,239
this variable let's um yeah because

2282
01:41:44,119 --> 01:41:50,560
instead of recent jobs we'll call it job

2283
01:41:48,239 --> 01:41:52,239
listings and then we're going to say if

2284
01:41:50,560 --> 01:41:56,520
is

2285
01:41:52,239 --> 01:41:58,719
home then we want to set that to job

2286
01:41:56,520 --> 01:42:01,760
slice just like we have it

2287
01:41:58,719 --> 01:42:03,360
else then we want to set it to just jobs

2288
01:42:01,760 --> 01:42:06,040
which is coming from the file which is

2289
01:42:03,360 --> 01:42:08,679
going to be all of the jobs and then

2290
01:42:06,040 --> 01:42:10,599
down here instead of creating a list

2291
01:42:08,679 --> 01:42:13,599
with recent jobs we'll create it with

2292
01:42:10,599 --> 01:42:16,040
job listings so now if I save that

2293
01:42:13,599 --> 01:42:18,400
you'll see now it shows all six now on

2294
01:42:16,040 --> 01:42:20,840
the homepage it shows all six however

2295
01:42:18,400 --> 01:42:24,239
let's go to our homepage and let's pass

2296
01:42:20,840 --> 01:42:27,560
in that prop of is home and we'll set

2297
01:42:24,239 --> 01:42:30,320
that to true so now if I save now we

2298
01:42:27,560 --> 01:42:32,520
only see the three on the homepage so

2299
01:42:30,320 --> 01:42:35,040
that takes care of that we could even

2300
01:42:32,520 --> 01:42:38,840
change the title based on if it's home

2301
01:42:35,040 --> 01:42:38,840
or not so let's

2302
01:42:39,040 --> 01:42:44,320
say let's say this if is

2303
01:42:42,280 --> 01:42:48,480
home

2304
01:42:44,320 --> 01:42:48,480
then let's show

2305
01:42:48,960 --> 01:42:53,719
um browse no we'll do

2306
01:42:51,920 --> 01:42:56,880
recent yeah

2307
01:42:53,719 --> 01:43:01,639
if it's home we'll say recent jobs else

2308
01:42:56,880 --> 01:43:05,280
we'll say all jobs or browse

2309
01:43:01,639 --> 01:43:05,280
jobs yeah browse

2310
01:43:06,159 --> 01:43:13,679
jobs so browse jobs recent jobs before

2311
01:43:10,800 --> 01:43:15,639
we get into the single page right if we

2312
01:43:13,679 --> 01:43:17,760
click on this we go to job slash and

2313
01:43:15,639 --> 01:43:20,760
then the ID before we do that let's

2314
01:43:17,760 --> 01:43:22,840
switch from just bringing in a Json file

2315
01:43:20,760 --> 01:43:23,800
to actually fetching data from a back

2316
01:43:22,840 --> 01:43:25,280
end

2317
01:43:23,800 --> 01:43:28,360
and to do this we're going to use

2318
01:43:25,280 --> 01:43:30,719
something called Json server which is a

2319
01:43:28,360 --> 01:43:34,679
fantastic library that basically lets

2320
01:43:30,719 --> 01:43:37,159
you create a mock API and you can send

2321
01:43:34,679 --> 01:43:39,920
get post put patch delete requests so

2322
01:43:37,159 --> 01:43:41,880
you can create crud functionality it can

2323
01:43:39,920 --> 01:43:44,199
be any resource you want because all you

2324
01:43:41,880 --> 01:43:46,560
have to do is create a Jason file which

2325
01:43:44,199 --> 01:43:49,480
we already have and you can put any type

2326
01:43:46,560 --> 01:43:52,239
of resource you want in it so we can use

2327
01:43:49,480 --> 01:43:54,760
our existing Json file we just have to

2328
01:43:52,239 --> 01:43:58,719
basically put back what we changed which

2329
01:43:54,760 --> 01:44:02,520
was make it an object that has uh a jobs

2330
01:43:58,719 --> 01:44:04,440
a a named jobs array and then we can

2331
01:44:02,520 --> 01:44:07,000
install Json server and then we can

2332
01:44:04,440 --> 01:44:09,800
simply run it like this so we can create

2333
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:11,719
an mpm script to run the server which

2334
01:44:09,800 --> 01:44:14,360
will run on a separate Port than our

2335
01:44:11,719 --> 01:44:18,440
front-end react app all right so let's

2336
01:44:14,360 --> 01:44:22,800
do that let's uh for now just close all

2337
01:44:18,440 --> 01:44:24,840
this stuff up and then the Json file the

2338
01:44:22,800 --> 01:44:27,320
J s. Json file we're going to go ahead

2339
01:44:24,840 --> 01:44:29,639
and just put opening curly brace here

2340
01:44:27,320 --> 01:44:33,440
and then a closing one at the

2341
01:44:29,639 --> 01:44:35,719
end and then we want to just name this

2342
01:44:33,440 --> 01:44:39,119
array so we're going to put double

2343
01:44:35,719 --> 01:44:40,880
quotes call this jobs and then set that

2344
01:44:39,119 --> 01:44:43,159
to that array now that's going to break

2345
01:44:40,880 --> 01:44:45,400
our application so if we go back you can

2346
01:44:43,159 --> 01:44:47,880
see it's broken because it's just

2347
01:44:45,400 --> 01:44:50,920
looking at the jobs file and it's

2348
01:44:47,880 --> 01:44:53,719
looking for an array not an object with

2349
01:44:50,920 --> 01:44:55,560
a an array in that object

2350
01:44:53,719 --> 01:44:57,080
so that's fine don't worry about it

2351
01:44:55,560 --> 01:45:00,040
being broken for now we're going to fix

2352
01:44:57,080 --> 01:45:02,520
it but let's come down and let's install

2353
01:45:00,040 --> 01:45:04,560
Jason server so I'm going to install as

2354
01:45:02,520 --> 01:45:07,040
a Dev dependency

2355
01:45:04,560 --> 01:45:09,520
Jason uh Jason

2356
01:45:07,040 --> 01:45:10,800
Dash right I believe it's I've done this

2357
01:45:09,520 --> 01:45:15,000
so many times I don't know why I don't

2358
01:45:10,800 --> 01:45:18,599
remember yeah it's Jason Dash

2359
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:21,480
server okay and then as far as the the

2360
01:45:18,599 --> 01:45:25,400
command to run Jason server we're going

2361
01:45:21,480 --> 01:45:30,800
to put that in our package Json file so

2362
01:45:25,400 --> 01:45:30,800
let's go here and then let's add

2363
01:45:31,159 --> 01:45:37,520
in um yeah we're going to add in a

2364
01:45:35,119 --> 01:45:39,760
server we'll put this at the bottom here

2365
01:45:37,520 --> 01:45:42,599
just put a comma and then we'll call

2366
01:45:39,760 --> 01:45:42,599
This

2367
01:45:43,199 --> 01:45:50,599
Server and what we want to run here is

2368
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:51,920
going to be Json Dash server and we want

2369
01:45:50,599 --> 01:45:53,800
to

2370
01:45:51,920 --> 01:45:56,440
d-at

2371
01:45:53,800 --> 01:46:00,280
in the source folder the

2372
01:45:56,440 --> 01:46:03,080
jobs. Json file and then

2373
01:46:00,280 --> 01:46:05,679
d-port now I I have something running on

2374
01:46:03,080 --> 01:46:07,080
Port 5000 on this machine that's usually

2375
01:46:05,679 --> 01:46:09,679
what I would use so I'm going to use

2376
01:46:07,080 --> 01:46:13,199
8,000 for the server but feel free to

2377
01:46:09,679 --> 01:46:15,480
use whatever Port you want I think it's

2378
01:46:13,199 --> 01:46:18,040
I think it's 5,000 by default I'm not

2379
01:46:15,480 --> 01:46:20,360
sure um but let's go ahead and save that

2380
01:46:18,040 --> 01:46:23,119
and then I'm going to run so I already

2381
01:46:20,360 --> 01:46:24,599
have my react Dev server running in this

2382
01:46:23,119 --> 01:46:27,760
terminal so I'm going to go into this

2383
01:46:24,599 --> 01:46:31,040
one and do npm run

2384
01:46:27,760 --> 01:46:34,480
server and as you can see we have an

2385
01:46:31,040 --> 01:46:36,080
endpoint of Local Host 8,000 jobs and if

2386
01:46:34,480 --> 01:46:39,199
I go to that in the browser I'm now

2387
01:46:36,080 --> 01:46:41,480
seeing my data I can even go to jobs

2388
01:46:39,199 --> 01:46:44,000
slash and then the ID and I get the

2389
01:46:41,480 --> 01:46:47,040
single post so it's it's just like if we

2390
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:49,400
built a rest API with Express or Django

2391
01:46:47,040 --> 01:46:51,840
or anything else we can also make post

2392
01:46:49,400 --> 01:46:54,280
requests and add one uh and it'll get

2393
01:46:51,840 --> 01:46:56,320
added to the actual Json file we can

2394
01:46:54,280 --> 01:46:59,560
edit we can send a put request we can

2395
01:46:56,320 --> 01:47:03,320
send a delete requests so we essentially

2396
01:46:59,560 --> 01:47:05,719
now have a backend all right so so where

2397
01:47:03,320 --> 01:47:09,040
I want to fetch this data is going to be

2398
01:47:05,719 --> 01:47:11,520
from the job listings component because

2399
01:47:09,040 --> 01:47:14,360
that's where that's the only place in

2400
01:47:11,520 --> 01:47:16,960
this application where we need the jobs

2401
01:47:14,360 --> 01:47:19,320
because we're using this component on

2402
01:47:16,960 --> 01:47:23,040
both we can't see it now but we're using

2403
01:47:19,320 --> 01:47:26,440
it on the homepage and on the jobs page

2404
01:47:23,040 --> 01:47:28,000
so let's uh let's change this up a

2405
01:47:26,440 --> 01:47:30,239
little bit we're no longer going to just

2406
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:32,280
bring in the jobs file we're going to

2407
01:47:30,239 --> 01:47:35,800
make a request and we're going to do

2408
01:47:32,280 --> 01:47:37,520
that inside of a use effect hook because

2409
01:47:35,800 --> 01:47:40,960
what the use effect hook does is it

2410
01:47:37,520 --> 01:47:43,639
allows our components to to um have side

2411
01:47:40,960 --> 01:47:46,119
effects and we want a side effect of

2412
01:47:43,639 --> 01:47:50,159
fetching data when the component

2413
01:47:46,119 --> 01:47:52,239
renders and when we get those those jobs

2414
01:47:50,159 --> 01:47:54,239
from the API we want to put them in

2415
01:47:52,239 --> 01:47:56,960
state so we want also want to bring in

2416
01:47:54,239 --> 01:48:01,199
used state so let's

2417
01:47:56,960 --> 01:48:05,199
import we're going to import Ed State

2418
01:48:01,199 --> 01:48:10,760
and use effect from

2419
01:48:05,199 --> 01:48:14,280
react and as far as the uh let's see

2420
01:48:10,760 --> 01:48:16,800
let's um yeah let's add the state we no

2421
01:48:14,280 --> 01:48:18,800
longer need this because we're not

2422
01:48:16,800 --> 01:48:21,800
dealing with

2423
01:48:18,800 --> 01:48:25,199
um yeah we'll just get rid of that and

2424
01:48:21,800 --> 01:48:28,159
then let's create our state so just like

2425
01:48:25,199 --> 01:48:30,400
we did with the show details in the um

2426
01:48:28,159 --> 01:48:34,199
job listing component we're going to add

2427
01:48:30,400 --> 01:48:35,920
a piece of State here for our jobs so

2428
01:48:34,199 --> 01:48:37,440
remember this takes two things the name

2429
01:48:35,920 --> 01:48:40,040
of the state and then the name of the

2430
01:48:37,440 --> 01:48:42,599
function to update the state so jobs and

2431
01:48:40,040 --> 01:48:44,520
set jobs and then the default value we

2432
01:48:42,599 --> 01:48:46,760
want for jobs goes in here which is

2433
01:48:44,520 --> 01:48:49,080
going to be just an empty array because

2434
01:48:46,760 --> 01:48:51,159
it's going to be an empty array will

2435
01:48:49,080 --> 01:48:53,119
make the request when the component

2436
01:48:51,159 --> 01:48:55,679
loads through the use effect and then

2437
01:48:53,119 --> 01:48:56,639
we'll fill this state with the response

2438
01:48:55,679 --> 01:48:59,480
from the

2439
01:48:56,639 --> 01:49:01,040
API now I'm also going to have a piece

2440
01:48:59,480 --> 01:49:04,639
of State for the

2441
01:49:01,040 --> 01:49:06,880
loading so loading and then set loading

2442
01:49:04,639 --> 01:49:09,920
so that way we can show a spinner or

2443
01:49:06,880 --> 01:49:11,880
something when it's actually fetching

2444
01:49:09,920 --> 01:49:13,639
and I'm going to set that to use State

2445
01:49:11,880 --> 01:49:16,239
and as a default I'm going to pass in

2446
01:49:13,639 --> 01:49:18,960
true and then once we do the fetching

2447
01:49:16,239 --> 01:49:22,480
and it's done then we'll change it to

2448
01:49:18,960 --> 01:49:24,960
false so now let's add our use effect so

2449
01:49:22,480 --> 01:49:26,880
we're we're going to say use effect now

2450
01:49:24,960 --> 01:49:28,800
the way this works is it takes in two

2451
01:49:26,880 --> 01:49:30,800
things it takes in a

2452
01:49:28,800 --> 01:49:33,719
function and then it takes in a

2453
01:49:30,800 --> 01:49:36,040
dependency array so if you put something

2454
01:49:33,719 --> 01:49:39,080
in here like let's say we had a variable

2455
01:49:36,040 --> 01:49:41,199
called name or something like that if we

2456
01:49:39,080 --> 01:49:44,960
put name in here then every time that

2457
01:49:41,199 --> 01:49:48,480
name changes this use effect will run

2458
01:49:44,960 --> 01:49:50,880
now you want to have an empty array in

2459
01:49:48,480 --> 01:49:52,440
here even if you don't have anything you

2460
01:49:50,880 --> 01:49:53,360
know any variables you want to put in

2461
01:49:52,440 --> 01:49:54,760
here

2462
01:49:53,360 --> 01:49:56,840
because if you don't it's going to just

2463
01:49:54,760 --> 01:49:59,000
be a NeverEnding Loop so you want to

2464
01:49:56,840 --> 01:50:03,199
have this empty array in there in in

2465
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:05,880
most cases and then in this function

2466
01:50:03,199 --> 01:50:07,880
here I want to do our fetching and I

2467
01:50:05,880 --> 01:50:10,320
want to use a sync a we however you

2468
01:50:07,880 --> 01:50:13,080
can't do this you can't say a

2469
01:50:10,320 --> 01:50:17,520
sync right I can't do that and then in

2470
01:50:13,080 --> 01:50:19,840
here say a weight fetch I can't do that

2471
01:50:17,520 --> 01:50:22,280
so what we need to do is create a

2472
01:50:19,840 --> 01:50:26,199
separate fun async function inside of

2473
01:50:22,280 --> 01:50:28,920
here so let's say cons fetch jobs set

2474
01:50:26,199 --> 01:50:28,920
that to

2475
01:50:29,360 --> 01:50:34,199
async and then we do our fetching and

2476
01:50:31,719 --> 01:50:37,199
then just make sure you call it so right

2477
01:50:34,199 --> 01:50:42,760
here we'll say fetch jobs so in here I'm

2478
01:50:37,199 --> 01:50:44,920
going to do const res set that to await

2479
01:50:42,760 --> 01:50:47,840
Fetch and we're going to pass in here

2480
01:50:44,920 --> 01:50:49,480
let's say HTTP and then our back end

2481
01:50:47,840 --> 01:50:51,800
which is Local

2482
01:50:49,480 --> 01:50:54,840
Host uh Local Host and I'll show you how

2483
01:50:51,800 --> 01:50:56,480
we can add a pro proxy uh after so we

2484
01:50:54,840 --> 01:50:59,000
don't have to always put in this Local

2485
01:50:56,480 --> 01:51:03,079
Host 8000 but for now we'll just add

2486
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:05,520
that and let's do slash jobs right

2487
01:51:03,079 --> 01:51:08,000
because that's what we saw in the

2488
01:51:05,520 --> 01:51:10,800
browser uh so if I were to do Local Host

2489
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:14,480
8,000 jobs that's our data so that's

2490
01:51:10,800 --> 01:51:18,079
what I'm getting here and then let's do

2491
01:51:14,480 --> 01:51:20,480
const data set that to

2492
01:51:18,079 --> 01:51:24,199
await res.

2493
01:51:20,480 --> 01:51:27,560
Json and that should give us our data

2494
01:51:24,199 --> 01:51:31,000
and what we want to do is set jobs we're

2495
01:51:27,560 --> 01:51:32,719
setting this this part of our state to

2496
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:35,639
the data that's

2497
01:51:32,719 --> 01:51:37,800
returned now i' I mean we don't have to

2498
01:51:35,639 --> 01:51:40,599
but I'd like to put this in a try catch

2499
01:51:37,800 --> 01:51:43,679
so let's do that and we'll take

2500
01:51:40,599 --> 01:51:44,520
these uh these three lines here and move

2501
01:51:43,679 --> 01:51:46,880
them

2502
01:51:44,520 --> 01:51:50,679
into the

2503
01:51:46,880 --> 01:51:52,760
try and then in the catch Oops in the

2504
01:51:50,679 --> 01:51:53,800
catch I'm just going to do uh cons so

2505
01:51:52,760 --> 01:51:56,119
log for

2506
01:51:53,800 --> 01:51:59,360
now and say

2507
01:51:56,119 --> 01:52:03,599
error fetching

2508
01:51:59,360 --> 01:52:07,119
data and we'll also pass in

2509
01:52:03,599 --> 01:52:09,639
error now we want to set loading to

2510
01:52:07,119 --> 01:52:12,079
false whether it's successful or not so

2511
01:52:09,639 --> 01:52:13,960
I could put set loading false here and

2512
01:52:12,079 --> 01:52:16,599
in here but since we have a try catch we

2513
01:52:13,960 --> 01:52:18,360
can just add a finally because whatever

2514
01:52:16,599 --> 01:52:20,199
we put in here will run either way

2515
01:52:18,360 --> 01:52:23,199
whether it fails or not so that's where

2516
01:52:20,199 --> 01:52:24,480
we want to put our set loading and set

2517
01:52:23,199 --> 01:52:27,159
that to

2518
01:52:24,480 --> 01:52:30,599
false all right and

2519
01:52:27,159 --> 01:52:33,480
then yeah so that should work and it's

2520
01:52:30,599 --> 01:52:36,440
going to put it into the jobs and then

2521
01:52:33,480 --> 01:52:38,560
down here let's change job listings back

2522
01:52:36,440 --> 01:52:41,960
to

2523
01:52:38,560 --> 01:52:45,800
jobs so we'll save that and then let's

2524
01:52:41,960 --> 01:52:47,599
go let's see home and now you can see we

2525
01:52:45,800 --> 01:52:50,079
have six again which is fine we'll H

2526
01:52:47,599 --> 01:52:52,639
we'll handle that if we go to the jobs

2527
01:52:50,079 --> 01:52:55,119
page there we go so these are coming

2528
01:52:52,639 --> 01:52:58,320
from our API now we're not just bringing

2529
01:52:55,119 --> 01:53:01,239
in the file and using the data we're

2530
01:52:58,320 --> 01:53:02,480
we're fetching from the the back end and

2531
01:53:01,239 --> 01:53:06,159
putting it

2532
01:53:02,480 --> 01:53:09,360
into uh putting it into the the job

2533
01:53:06,159 --> 01:53:12,040
State now let's use this loading

2534
01:53:09,360 --> 01:53:13,719
value and come down here where we're

2535
01:53:12,040 --> 01:53:16,079
we're creating the list with the with

2536
01:53:13,719 --> 01:53:19,960
the map I'm going to go right above that

2537
01:53:16,079 --> 01:53:23,360
and let's say if loading then we'll show

2538
01:53:19,960 --> 01:53:26,199
for now we'll just do we'll just put in

2539
01:53:23,360 --> 01:53:29,400
H2 and we'll say loading But ultimately

2540
01:53:26,199 --> 01:53:32,159
I want to show a spinner and then

2541
01:53:29,400 --> 01:53:35,719
else then let's

2542
01:53:32,159 --> 01:53:38,719
show uh we'll just have a fragment and

2543
01:53:35,719 --> 01:53:42,800
then I'm going to put this right here

2544
01:53:38,719 --> 01:53:45,840
this job list into that

2545
01:53:42,800 --> 01:53:48,440
fragment uh what did I do here loading

2546
01:53:45,840 --> 01:53:52,199
I'm sorry that should be a question

2547
01:53:48,440 --> 01:53:53,840
mark there we go so now when I reload

2548
01:53:52,199 --> 01:53:56,320
you can you can see it flashes loading

2549
01:53:53,840 --> 01:53:58,199
on the screen real quick so that's

2550
01:53:56,320 --> 01:54:02,360
that's when we're actually fetching the

2551
01:53:58,199 --> 01:54:04,480
data now I want to use a spinner so

2552
01:54:02,360 --> 01:54:07,800
there's a a package we can use called

2553
01:54:04,480 --> 01:54:09,560
react Spinners that allows us to um to

2554
01:54:07,800 --> 01:54:11,840
easily show a spinner you could just

2555
01:54:09,560 --> 01:54:13,280
throw an image in there but uh I'm just

2556
01:54:11,840 --> 01:54:15,480
going to use this so I'm going to open a

2557
01:54:13,280 --> 01:54:18,800
new terminal cuz both of these are

2558
01:54:15,480 --> 01:54:22,040
running whoops both of these are running

2559
01:54:18,800 --> 01:54:27,280
uh the the back end and the front end so

2560
01:54:22,040 --> 01:54:29,440
let's say npm install react Das

2561
01:54:27,280 --> 01:54:31,719
Spinners and let me just show you this

2562
01:54:29,440 --> 01:54:31,719
real

2563
01:54:34,079 --> 01:54:39,880
quick let see react

2564
01:54:37,520 --> 01:54:43,560
Spinners yes so you can show like all

2565
01:54:39,880 --> 01:54:46,520
these things I want the GitHub

2566
01:54:43,560 --> 01:54:48,280
page okay so the way that we use it is

2567
01:54:46,520 --> 01:54:50,520
like this we

2568
01:54:48,280 --> 01:54:53,239
can uh let's

2569
01:54:50,520 --> 01:54:55,000
see so we can bring we can use the clip

2570
01:54:53,239 --> 01:54:56,599
loader so apparently there's different

2571
01:54:55,000 --> 01:54:59,960
loaders we're going to use just use the

2572
01:54:56,599 --> 01:55:02,000
clip loader and then put it in like

2573
01:54:59,960 --> 01:55:04,920
this

2574
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:08,560
um yeah let's

2575
01:55:04,920 --> 01:55:12,480
uh let's create a new

2576
01:55:08,560 --> 01:55:16,520
component let's call it spinner.

2577
01:55:12,480 --> 01:55:19,320
jsx RAF CE so you can see literally

2578
01:55:16,520 --> 01:55:24,000
everything is a component or can be a

2579
01:55:19,320 --> 01:55:27,880
component so in this component let's

2580
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:31,760
import CLI uh what is it clip

2581
01:55:27,880 --> 01:55:33,360
loader and that's going to be from react

2582
01:55:31,760 --> 01:55:36,239
Spinners

2583
01:55:33,360 --> 01:55:37,840
slash clip loader so we want to bring

2584
01:55:36,239 --> 01:55:40,320
that in and

2585
01:55:37,840 --> 01:55:42,400
then spinner is going to take in the

2586
01:55:40,320 --> 01:55:45,480
loading State as a prop so let's

2587
01:55:42,400 --> 01:55:48,000
destructure and add in loading and then

2588
01:55:45,480 --> 01:55:50,320
we're going to return the clip loader

2589
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:52,880
component so here let's

2590
01:55:50,320 --> 01:55:55,719
say clip loader

2591
01:55:52,880 --> 01:55:57,440
and this is going to be a self

2592
01:55:55,719 --> 01:55:59,800
closing yeah this is going to be a

2593
01:55:57,440 --> 01:56:02,000
self-closing component so let's say clip

2594
01:55:59,800 --> 01:56:05,639
loader like that and then it's going to

2595
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:09,280
take in some arguments here some props

2596
01:56:05,639 --> 01:56:12,000
so for the color let's do heximal

2597
01:56:09,280 --> 01:56:15,280
4338

2598
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:18,320
CA and let's do loading which is going

2599
01:56:15,280 --> 01:56:19,840
to be set to the Loading prop that's

2600
01:56:18,320 --> 01:56:22,599
passed

2601
01:56:19,840 --> 01:56:24,199
in and then we're going to add a CS

2602
01:56:22,599 --> 01:56:26,960
override because we want to just add a

2603
01:56:24,199 --> 01:56:29,480
couple custom styles to center it so

2604
01:56:26,960 --> 01:56:31,840
let's set that to a variable called

2605
01:56:29,480 --> 01:56:34,679
override and what we'll do is come up

2606
01:56:31,840 --> 01:56:37,079
here and create const override just like

2607
01:56:34,679 --> 01:56:39,760
I showed you before we can put Styles in

2608
01:56:37,079 --> 01:56:42,079
a variable so all I want to do is add a

2609
01:56:39,760 --> 01:56:45,480
display of

2610
01:56:42,079 --> 01:56:49,480
block uh put a comma here and then a

2611
01:56:45,480 --> 01:56:51,920
margin let's say um we'll do 100 pixels

2612
01:56:49,480 --> 01:56:54,079
top and bottom and auto left and right

2613
01:56:51,920 --> 01:56:56,520
so that that'll put it in the middle and

2614
01:56:54,079 --> 01:57:00,400
then we're adding that to the CSS

2615
01:56:56,520 --> 01:57:02,040
override prop for the size we'll set

2616
01:57:00,400 --> 01:57:05,280
that to

2617
01:57:02,040 --> 01:57:08,400
150 and yeah that should be good so

2618
01:57:05,280 --> 01:57:10,960
let's save that now in our job listings

2619
01:57:08,400 --> 01:57:14,520
we're going to bring that component

2620
01:57:10,960 --> 01:57:17,159
in so import our

2621
01:57:14,520 --> 01:57:19,199
spinner and we can come down here where

2622
01:57:17,159 --> 01:57:22,440
we have this loading and just replace

2623
01:57:19,199 --> 01:57:26,119
that with the spinner component and then

2624
01:57:22,440 --> 01:57:30,360
pass in our loading

2625
01:57:26,119 --> 01:57:32,679
state so let's take a look at that if I

2626
01:57:30,360 --> 01:57:34,480
reload okay you can see the spinner real

2627
01:57:32,679 --> 01:57:37,400
quick it's not in the middle

2628
01:57:34,480 --> 01:57:39,679
though U I'm not sure

2629
01:57:37,400 --> 01:57:43,199
why as we

2630
01:57:39,679 --> 01:57:43,199
have we have our

2631
01:57:45,400 --> 01:57:51,800
override um yeah it should be in the

2632
01:57:48,760 --> 01:57:54,119
middle oh we have it in the grid that's

2633
01:57:51,800 --> 01:57:54,119
why

2634
01:57:54,440 --> 01:58:00,960
okay so we should probably put this

2635
01:57:57,719 --> 01:58:04,440
div inside yeah let's do that we'll put

2636
01:58:00,960 --> 01:58:08,840
that here and then this ending div put

2637
01:58:04,440 --> 01:58:10,280
that here so now there we go so now it's

2638
01:58:08,840 --> 01:58:11,679
in the middle and it should do the same

2639
01:58:10,280 --> 01:58:12,960
thing on the homepage because remember

2640
01:58:11,679 --> 01:58:14,480
it's the same

2641
01:58:12,960 --> 01:58:17,599
component

2642
01:58:14,480 --> 01:58:19,599
yep all right and now you can use that

2643
01:58:17,599 --> 01:58:20,840
spinner wherever you fetch data and you

2644
01:58:19,599 --> 01:58:23,599
want to show

2645
01:58:20,840 --> 01:58:26,599
it so so let's take care of the the

2646
01:58:23,599 --> 01:58:27,840
homepage having uh having all six we

2647
01:58:26,599 --> 01:58:31,239
don't want to do that we only want to

2648
01:58:27,840 --> 01:58:32,639
show three so what we could do there's

2649
01:58:31,239 --> 01:58:35,719
there's so many different ways we could

2650
01:58:32,639 --> 01:58:39,840
handle this but what I'm going to

2651
01:58:35,719 --> 01:58:42,320
do is come up to the fetch jobs so we

2652
01:58:39,840 --> 01:58:46,520
have is home being passed in so let's

2653
01:58:42,320 --> 01:58:49,119
utilize that so in the fetch jobs let's

2654
01:58:46,520 --> 01:58:51,520
do const AP and let me just show you

2655
01:58:49,119 --> 01:58:53,719
that you can add on to this with Jason

2656
01:58:51,520 --> 01:58:58,239
server this is another cool feature you

2657
01:58:53,719 --> 01:59:00,280
can do question markor limit equals 3

2658
01:58:58,239 --> 01:59:02,599
and if I save that now it's only showing

2659
01:59:00,280 --> 01:59:05,520
three however the jobs page is also

2660
01:59:02,599 --> 01:59:08,599
showing three so what we're going to do

2661
01:59:05,520 --> 01:59:12,840
is first of all let's say API

2662
01:59:08,599 --> 01:59:16,360
URL and we're going to set that and say

2663
01:59:12,840 --> 01:59:20,040
if is home right so if is home is passed

2664
01:59:16,360 --> 01:59:23,440
in if that's true then we want the a you

2665
01:59:20,040 --> 01:59:27,520
want the URL to

2666
01:59:23,440 --> 01:59:31,520
be this because we want three

2667
01:59:27,520 --> 01:59:32,480
else then we want it to be this without

2668
01:59:31,520 --> 01:59:35,079
the

2669
01:59:32,480 --> 01:59:39,280
limit okay and then we can simply

2670
01:59:35,079 --> 01:59:41,440
replace this Fetch with the API URL so

2671
01:59:39,280 --> 01:59:43,880
now we have six on the jobs page and we

2672
01:59:41,440 --> 01:59:46,480
have three on the

2673
01:59:43,880 --> 01:59:48,560
homage cool so now I'm going to show you

2674
01:59:46,480 --> 01:59:51,480
how to add a proxy so that you don't

2675
01:59:48,560 --> 01:59:53,679
have to add this because if we if we

2676
01:59:51,480 --> 01:59:56,599
deploy this this project it's no longer

2677
01:59:53,679 --> 01:59:58,639
going to be at Local Host 8000 so we

2678
01:59:56,599 --> 02:00:01,199
need to create a proxy now if you've

2679
01:59:58,639 --> 02:00:02,440
ever used create react app then you know

2680
02:00:01,199 --> 02:00:04,760
that you do that within your

2681
02:00:02,440 --> 02:00:07,079
package.json with v it's a little

2682
02:00:04,760 --> 02:00:10,280
different we do that within the config

2683
02:00:07,079 --> 02:00:15,239
file so let's go to

2684
02:00:10,280 --> 02:00:19,079
V uh V config and in the server object

2685
02:00:15,239 --> 02:00:21,599
under the port we're going to add a

2686
02:00:19,079 --> 02:00:25,199
proxy and basically we're going to say

2687
02:00:21,599 --> 02:00:29,079
if it's if it is prefixed with SL

2688
02:00:25,199 --> 02:00:30,920
API then we want to use this so we're

2689
02:00:29,079 --> 02:00:33,880
going to set that to an object with a

2690
02:00:30,920 --> 02:00:38,400
Target and that Target is going to be

2691
02:00:33,880 --> 02:00:40,880
HTTP Local Host Port 8000 or whatever

2692
02:00:38,400 --> 02:00:43,280
Port you use for Jason server we're

2693
02:00:40,880 --> 02:00:46,679
going to add change origin and set that

2694
02:00:43,280 --> 02:00:50,400
to true and then we're going to do a

2695
02:00:46,679 --> 02:00:53,960
rewrite and set that to that takes in a

2696
02:00:50,400 --> 02:00:56,520
function with a path and we're going to

2697
02:00:53,960 --> 02:00:59,520
then just use uh

2698
02:00:56,520 --> 02:01:02,360
replace and pass in an expression for

2699
02:00:59,520 --> 02:01:07,119
slash API so it's going to be double

2700
02:01:02,360 --> 02:01:12,000
forward slash and then uh carrot back

2701
02:01:07,119 --> 02:01:14,280
slash back SL SL API like that and

2702
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:16,920
replace that with

2703
02:01:14,280 --> 02:01:20,480
nothing all right so that way if we do

2704
02:01:16,920 --> 02:01:22,760
SL API slj jobs it's really going to hit

2705
02:01:20,480 --> 02:01:25,280
Local Host SL

2706
02:01:22,760 --> 02:01:28,400
jobs so let's try that out we'll come

2707
02:01:25,280 --> 02:01:33,400
over here and then let's change this

2708
02:01:28,400 --> 02:01:37,400
this and this to just slash API like

2709
02:01:33,400 --> 02:01:39,800
that and let's reload and it still

2710
02:01:37,400 --> 02:01:41,800
works all right so now anytime you want

2711
02:01:39,800 --> 02:01:44,400
to use the back end you want to send a

2712
02:01:41,800 --> 02:01:45,639
request you simply do slash API and

2713
02:01:44,400 --> 02:01:49,599
you're not going to have to change

2714
02:01:45,639 --> 02:01:52,119
anything once you um you well you're

2715
02:01:49,599 --> 02:01:54,159
going to have to change it here but you

2716
02:01:52,119 --> 02:01:56,360
have to change it uh you know in every

2717
02:01:54,159 --> 02:01:58,400
single file that you you that you make a

2718
02:01:56,360 --> 02:02:01,440
request when you

2719
02:01:58,400 --> 02:02:04,840
deploy so that's that's basically data

2720
02:02:01,440 --> 02:02:07,320
fetching uh using use effect now there

2721
02:02:04,840 --> 02:02:10,400
are other ways to fetch data so you're

2722
02:02:07,320 --> 02:02:13,280
probably going to run into those um

2723
02:02:10,400 --> 02:02:15,199
there is something called react suspense

2724
02:02:13,280 --> 02:02:17,599
which is included with react and it

2725
02:02:15,199 --> 02:02:20,679
allows you to do a render while fetching

2726
02:02:17,599 --> 02:02:23,639
what we're doing here is uh fetch on

2727
02:02:20,679 --> 02:02:26,400
render because when it renders it has a

2728
02:02:23,639 --> 02:02:28,520
side effect of fetching the data but

2729
02:02:26,400 --> 02:02:30,599
suspense will allow you to render while

2730
02:02:28,520 --> 02:02:33,480
fetching and you basically provide a

2731
02:02:30,599 --> 02:02:35,760
fallback UI such as a spinner or a

2732
02:02:33,480 --> 02:02:39,360
loading text whatever you pass that in

2733
02:02:35,760 --> 02:02:40,880
as a prop or as an attribute um now I'm

2734
02:02:39,360 --> 02:02:42,960
not going to do that in this video I

2735
02:02:40,880 --> 02:02:45,520
think it's kind of beyond the scope I do

2736
02:02:42,960 --> 02:02:47,599
have an older suspense tutorial from

2737
02:02:45,520 --> 02:02:49,040
from when it first came out or you can

2738
02:02:47,599 --> 02:02:51,480
just check the

2739
02:02:49,040 --> 02:02:54,400
documentation um what else there's also

2740
02:02:51,480 --> 02:02:56,760
something called react query which is a

2741
02:02:54,400 --> 02:02:59,639
third-party Library there's one called s

2742
02:02:56,760 --> 02:03:02,639
SWR as well and that those make data

2743
02:02:59,639 --> 02:03:03,880
fetching a little easier than this um so

2744
02:03:02,639 --> 02:03:06,920
that's something you might want to check

2745
02:03:03,880 --> 02:03:09,960
out as well but this is like the base

2746
02:03:06,920 --> 02:03:12,360
way of of fetching from a client side

2747
02:03:09,960 --> 02:03:16,040
component all right and then also with

2748
02:03:12,360 --> 02:03:18,599
react 19 you have the new use hook which

2749
02:03:16,040 --> 02:03:20,880
you can also um look into as well in

2750
02:03:18,599 --> 02:03:23,199
fact that react 19 video I did I give

2751
02:03:20,880 --> 02:03:25,480
you some examples with that so there's a

2752
02:03:23,199 --> 02:03:27,639
lot of that's the thing with react is

2753
02:03:25,480 --> 02:03:29,440
there's so many different ways to to do

2754
02:03:27,639 --> 02:03:31,119
the same exact thing and some people

2755
02:03:29,440 --> 02:03:32,719
will say that's wrong you know do it

2756
02:03:31,119 --> 02:03:34,760
this way and another person will say

2757
02:03:32,719 --> 02:03:37,400
that that's wrong so you just need to

2758
02:03:34,760 --> 02:03:40,960
kind of do what works for

2759
02:03:37,400 --> 02:03:43,480
you all right so now we can start to

2760
02:03:40,960 --> 02:03:46,559
work on the single page right this right

2761
02:03:43,480 --> 02:03:48,079
here job slash and then the ID and the

2762
02:03:46,559 --> 02:03:49,320
way that we're going to get this data is

2763
02:03:48,079 --> 02:03:52,480
going to be a little different we're

2764
02:03:49,320 --> 02:03:54,800
going to use uh a data loader from react

2765
02:03:52,480 --> 02:03:57,159
router which is actually pretty cool but

2766
02:03:54,800 --> 02:03:59,239
we first have to create the actual page

2767
02:03:57,159 --> 02:04:01,840
for the single job so let's close all

2768
02:03:59,239 --> 02:04:05,320
that up and then under Pages let's

2769
02:04:01,840 --> 02:04:06,079
create let's say job page singular and

2770
02:04:05,320 --> 02:04:07,960
then

2771
02:04:06,079 --> 02:04:10,639
jsx

2772
02:04:07,960 --> 02:04:12,920
rafc save that and then before we add

2773
02:04:10,639 --> 02:04:14,880
anything here let's create the route so

2774
02:04:12,920 --> 02:04:20,559
we're going to go to our app jsx we're

2775
02:04:14,880 --> 02:04:22,599
going to bring in the job page and then

2776
02:04:20,559 --> 02:04:26,360
we want we want to add the route so that

2777
02:04:22,599 --> 02:04:29,159
if we go to job slash and then any ID

2778
02:04:26,360 --> 02:04:32,559
that it loads this this page so I'm

2779
02:04:29,159 --> 02:04:36,280
going to copy this down and let's do job

2780
02:04:32,559 --> 02:04:40,719
page make sure you import it and then

2781
02:04:36,280 --> 02:04:43,320
for the the path we're going to do

2782
02:04:40,719 --> 02:04:45,440
job well actually you know what let's do

2783
02:04:43,320 --> 02:04:48,000
jobs I like to kind of keep these the

2784
02:04:45,440 --> 02:04:49,920
same even though it's a single job I

2785
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:51,440
think I'm going to keep jobs but you

2786
02:04:49,920 --> 02:04:53,639
could you could do what you want and

2787
02:04:51,440 --> 02:04:54,760
then we're going to do colon ID now the

2788
02:04:53,639 --> 02:04:57,559
colon

2789
02:04:54,760 --> 02:05:01,159
represents it basically signifies that

2790
02:04:57,559 --> 02:05:03,159
this is dynamic so it's not a literal ID

2791
02:05:01,159 --> 02:05:05,719
the Letter's ID that you're passing in

2792
02:05:03,159 --> 02:05:08,719
it's a it's a symbol or a variable for

2793
02:05:05,719 --> 02:05:11,119
whatever the ID is all right so let's

2794
02:05:08,719 --> 02:05:12,320
save that and then if we go back here

2795
02:05:11,119 --> 02:05:15,840
and

2796
02:05:12,320 --> 02:05:20,040
reload or let's

2797
02:05:15,840 --> 02:05:24,920
just uh let's see why isn't that

2798
02:05:20,040 --> 02:05:28,599
working so SL job oh because I have job

2799
02:05:24,920 --> 02:05:31,880
ID so let's change the the link in the

2800
02:05:28,599 --> 02:05:33,760
job listing component so job listing I'm

2801
02:05:31,880 --> 02:05:37,199
going to say jobs

2802
02:05:33,760 --> 02:05:38,840
slid so now click it and there we go so

2803
02:05:37,199 --> 02:05:41,360
now we're seeing the job page and it

2804
02:05:38,840 --> 02:05:44,040
doesn't matter what the ID is here we're

2805
02:05:41,360 --> 02:05:47,920
still we're still loading that page now

2806
02:05:44,040 --> 02:05:50,599
let's close up job listing closeup app

2807
02:05:47,920 --> 02:05:52,639
and again there's so many ways to fetch

2808
02:05:50,599 --> 02:05:54,400
data and we could do the same exact

2809
02:05:52,639 --> 02:05:57,040
thing we did in the job listings

2810
02:05:54,400 --> 02:06:00,040
component we can use a use effect so

2811
02:05:57,040 --> 02:06:05,559
that when this page loads uh we get the

2812
02:06:00,040 --> 02:06:07,960
job now what I want to do is use a data

2813
02:06:05,559 --> 02:06:10,239
loader from react router so this is

2814
02:06:07,960 --> 02:06:12,960
going to work a little bit different

2815
02:06:10,239 --> 02:06:16,280
than um than we did with the job

2816
02:06:12,960 --> 02:06:19,079
listings now a data loader we basically

2817
02:06:16,280 --> 02:06:21,280
create a function in this file and then

2818
02:06:19,079 --> 02:06:22,599
we can export it from this file and then

2819
02:06:21,280 --> 02:06:27,559
use that

2820
02:06:22,599 --> 02:06:30,280
function in in other areas so we can use

2821
02:06:27,559 --> 02:06:32,719
this in basically as our Global state

2822
02:06:30,280 --> 02:06:35,520
for for whatever this job is and pass it

2823
02:06:32,719 --> 02:06:40,559
into other components so the way that we

2824
02:06:35,520 --> 02:06:42,800
do this is let's see we're going

2825
02:06:40,559 --> 02:06:45,280
to where should we do this let's go

2826
02:06:42,800 --> 02:06:48,400
right under the function here the job

2827
02:06:45,280 --> 02:06:50,960
page function and we're going to

2828
02:06:48,400 --> 02:06:52,880
create a function I'm going to use an

2829
02:06:50,960 --> 02:06:54,199
arrow but if you want to use a regular

2830
02:06:52,880 --> 02:06:56,559
function you can we're going to call

2831
02:06:54,199 --> 02:06:58,400
this job loader right and then we're

2832
02:06:56,559 --> 02:07:03,000
going to set this to

2833
02:06:58,400 --> 02:07:04,960
async and it's going to take in actually

2834
02:07:03,000 --> 02:07:08,440
we'll

2835
02:07:04,960 --> 02:07:09,599
uh yeah we got to pass in params because

2836
02:07:08,440 --> 02:07:12,440
that's how we're how we're going to get

2837
02:07:09,599 --> 02:07:14,360
the ID you know what I'm going to show

2838
02:07:12,440 --> 02:07:16,239
you how to do it with use effect first

2839
02:07:14,360 --> 02:07:18,239
because I don't feel I don't feel

2840
02:07:16,239 --> 02:07:22,119
confident enough that I that I showed

2841
02:07:18,239 --> 02:07:25,000
you enough fetching with use effect so

2842
02:07:22,119 --> 02:07:26,360
let's let's do that first and then we'll

2843
02:07:25,000 --> 02:07:28,559
change it up and I'll show you how to

2844
02:07:26,360 --> 02:07:30,000
use a data loader so I'm going to import

2845
02:07:28,559 --> 02:07:33,480
use

2846
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:35,040
State and use

2847
02:07:33,480 --> 02:07:37,360
effect

2848
02:07:35,040 --> 02:07:40,920
from

2849
02:07:37,360 --> 02:07:44,639
react and let's see we'll we'll add the

2850
02:07:40,920 --> 02:07:47,119
job to the state so let's say const and

2851
02:07:44,639 --> 02:07:49,719
just job and then set

2852
02:07:47,119 --> 02:07:54,000
job all right and then we'll set that to

2853
02:07:49,719 --> 02:07:57,360
use state and then as far as

2854
02:07:54,000 --> 02:08:00,960
um as far as the default we'll just

2855
02:07:57,360 --> 02:08:06,360
do we'll just we'll just do null for the

2856
02:08:00,960 --> 02:08:06,360
default and then we'll have our use

2857
02:08:06,679 --> 02:08:12,320
effect and the use

2858
02:08:09,599 --> 02:08:16,239
effect again takes in a

2859
02:08:12,320 --> 02:08:16,239
function and dependency

2860
02:08:16,520 --> 02:08:21,719
array and I'm going to create a function

2861
02:08:19,400 --> 02:08:24,719
just like we did in the how we you know

2862
02:08:21,719 --> 02:08:26,360
when we got all the jobs we're going to

2863
02:08:24,719 --> 02:08:31,679
have this this is going to be called

2864
02:08:26,360 --> 02:08:31,679
Fetch job and this is going to be a

2865
02:08:31,719 --> 02:08:36,760
sync and then we want to call it down

2866
02:08:34,360 --> 02:08:40,040
here I like to do this first because I

2867
02:08:36,760 --> 02:08:42,880
always forget to call it and then in the

2868
02:08:40,040 --> 02:08:45,920
fetch job basically we can probably just

2869
02:08:42,880 --> 02:08:49,960
copy what we did in the job

2870
02:08:45,920 --> 02:08:49,960
listings uh like this stuff

2871
02:08:50,079 --> 02:08:55,960
here we'll just grab the TR

2872
02:08:53,719 --> 02:08:57,719
catch I'm probably going to change this

2873
02:08:55,960 --> 02:09:00,760
up after

2874
02:08:57,719 --> 02:09:04,280
but let's do HTT oh we don't need HTTP

2875
02:09:00,760 --> 02:09:07,559
anymore we just do slash API SL job now

2876
02:09:04,280 --> 02:09:11,000
we need the ID so how do we get that we

2877
02:09:07,559 --> 02:09:15,000
can get that using the use params Hook

2878
02:09:11,000 --> 02:09:18,360
from react router Dom so let's say

2879
02:09:15,000 --> 02:09:20,679
import use

2880
02:09:18,360 --> 02:09:22,760
pams and that's going to be from react

2881
02:09:20,679 --> 02:09:24,920
router Dawn and then the way that we do

2882
02:09:22,760 --> 02:09:26,400
this is we can come we can go right here

2883
02:09:24,920 --> 02:09:30,840
at the top and we're going to

2884
02:09:26,400 --> 02:09:30,840
destructure from use

2885
02:09:31,159 --> 02:09:34,840
params and we want to destructure and

2886
02:09:33,639 --> 02:09:37,760
get the

2887
02:09:34,840 --> 02:09:40,280
ID okay so that should give me the ID

2888
02:09:37,760 --> 02:09:42,440
and then in here let's replace these

2889
02:09:40,280 --> 02:09:46,760
quotes with back

2890
02:09:42,440 --> 02:09:48,559
ticks and we'll say API job slash and

2891
02:09:46,760 --> 02:09:51,880
then the

2892
02:09:48,559 --> 02:09:54,599
ID okay then we get the data and then

2893
02:09:51,880 --> 02:09:57,000
instead of set jobs we're going to do

2894
02:09:54,599 --> 02:09:59,559
set job

2895
02:09:57,000 --> 02:10:02,679
data

2896
02:09:59,559 --> 02:10:06,559
and yeah I

2897
02:10:02,679 --> 02:10:09,480
think that's fine yeah I think that's

2898
02:10:06,559 --> 02:10:11,800
good um oh the loading State we didn't

2899
02:10:09,480 --> 02:10:11,800
do

2900
02:10:11,920 --> 02:10:18,880
that so we want to do

2901
02:10:15,480 --> 02:10:18,880
loading set

2902
02:10:20,320 --> 02:10:24,920
loading

2903
02:10:22,400 --> 02:10:29,079
that's going to be true by

2904
02:10:24,920 --> 02:10:32,239
default okay and let's see what else um

2905
02:10:29,079 --> 02:10:32,239
let's bring in the spinner

2906
02:10:35,679 --> 02:10:41,639
component and

2907
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:46,480
then for the return let's

2908
02:10:41,639 --> 02:10:50,040
do return if loading

2909
02:10:46,480 --> 02:10:54,920
then show the spinner

2910
02:10:50,040 --> 02:10:58,800
else yeah else then we'll just put in H1

2911
02:10:54,920 --> 02:10:58,800
for now and just say

2912
02:10:59,360 --> 02:11:05,840
job and I want to make sure we get the

2913
02:11:01,920 --> 02:11:09,280
job data so why don't

2914
02:11:05,840 --> 02:11:11,000
we why don't we put in this

2915
02:11:09,280 --> 02:11:14,000
H1

2916
02:11:11,000 --> 02:11:14,000
job.

2917
02:11:15,239 --> 02:11:21,730
title cannot read property

2918
02:11:18,800 --> 02:11:23,719
null so we're setting the job the

2919
02:11:21,730 --> 02:11:26,880
[Music]

2920
02:11:23,719 --> 02:11:30,320
data uh let's see let's let's do a

2921
02:11:26,880 --> 02:11:30,320
console log of

2922
02:11:34,760 --> 02:11:44,199
data responded with a status of 404 oh I

2923
02:11:40,239 --> 02:11:45,960
think it's jobs yeah there we go so

2924
02:11:44,199 --> 02:11:48,239
we're seeing the

2925
02:11:45,960 --> 02:11:50,840
title and we're seeing it in the whole

2926
02:11:48,239 --> 02:11:53,320
thing in the console so just to kind of

2927
02:11:50,840 --> 02:11:55,360
reiterate what's going on here the

2928
02:11:53,320 --> 02:11:58,159
component loads it has a side effect

2929
02:11:55,360 --> 02:12:00,800
where we fetch the data from this from

2930
02:11:58,159 --> 02:12:02,719
API jobs and whatever the ID is in the

2931
02:12:00,800 --> 02:12:06,360
URL and we're getting that because of

2932
02:12:02,719 --> 02:12:07,840
the used pams Hook from react router Dom

2933
02:12:06,360 --> 02:12:10,360
and then once we get the data we're

2934
02:12:07,840 --> 02:12:11,960
setting it to the state we down here

2935
02:12:10,360 --> 02:12:13,800
we're saying if it's loading show the

2936
02:12:11,960 --> 02:12:16,079
spinner so if I reload you can see the

2937
02:12:13,800 --> 02:12:18,520
spinner real quick and then once it's

2938
02:12:16,079 --> 02:12:21,199
loaded it shows an H1 with the title

2939
02:12:18,520 --> 02:12:23,800
which is this right here okay so that's

2940
02:12:21,199 --> 02:12:26,119
how we can get the data just using use

2941
02:12:23,800 --> 02:12:30,040
effect now I'm going to show you another

2942
02:12:26,119 --> 02:12:32,280
way to do this using react routers data

2943
02:12:30,040 --> 02:12:34,840
loaders and we can do this without

2944
02:12:32,280 --> 02:12:35,800
having to do the use effect and we can

2945
02:12:34,840 --> 02:12:39,440
also

2946
02:12:35,800 --> 02:12:41,920
export the the data as well from this

2947
02:12:39,440 --> 02:12:43,440
component so we can use it elsewhere and

2948
02:12:41,920 --> 02:12:45,320
we will use it elsewhere we're going to

2949
02:12:43,440 --> 02:12:47,079
use it in the edit page because in the

2950
02:12:45,320 --> 02:12:49,960
edit page we do the same thing we have

2951
02:12:47,079 --> 02:12:51,679
to fetch the job so I'm going to get rid

2952
02:12:49,960 --> 02:12:53,520
of this if you want to just kind comment

2953
02:12:51,679 --> 02:12:55,320
it out so you still have it you can do

2954
02:12:53,520 --> 02:12:57,559
that but I'm going to get rid of that

2955
02:12:55,320 --> 02:13:00,280
I'm also going to get rid of the two

2956
02:12:57,559 --> 02:13:02,280
states and I'm even going to get rid of

2957
02:13:00,280 --> 02:13:04,119
um the use State and use effect I'm

2958
02:13:02,280 --> 02:13:07,719
still going to get the params because I

2959
02:13:04,119 --> 02:13:10,760
do need the ID still and uh yeah we'll

2960
02:13:07,719 --> 02:13:13,800
keep that as well but what we can

2961
02:13:10,760 --> 02:13:17,679
do is go under the function above the

2962
02:13:13,800 --> 02:13:20,159
export and let's say cons job

2963
02:13:17,679 --> 02:13:22,960
loader and remember this is a this is a

2964
02:13:20,159 --> 02:13:26,800
feature of react router not react

2965
02:13:22,960 --> 02:13:30,639
itself so let's set that and we're going

2966
02:13:26,800 --> 02:13:30,639
to pass in an object with

2967
02:13:31,079 --> 02:13:35,239
param okay and then in the job loader

2968
02:13:33,960 --> 02:13:38,480
this is where we're going to make our

2969
02:13:35,239 --> 02:13:41,679
requests so let's say resz equals

2970
02:13:38,480 --> 02:13:44,920
await uh await

2971
02:13:41,679 --> 02:13:48,000
Fetch and it's going to be let's see

2972
02:13:44,920 --> 02:13:49,719
let's use back tick here and then slash

2973
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:51,960
API

2974
02:13:49,719 --> 02:13:53,880
jobs and

2975
02:13:51,960 --> 02:13:56,760
the ID we should be able to get from

2976
02:13:53,880 --> 02:14:00,320
that pams

2977
02:13:56,760 --> 02:14:04,480
doid then we'll say cons data set that

2978
02:14:00,320 --> 02:14:06,639
to await and then res.

2979
02:14:04,480 --> 02:14:09,280
Json and then we're simply going to

2980
02:14:06,639 --> 02:14:10,960
return the data from this function okay

2981
02:14:09,280 --> 02:14:13,960
so a loader is just going to return the

2982
02:14:10,960 --> 02:14:17,239
data now we want to export it but we

2983
02:14:13,960 --> 02:14:20,040
also want to still export um job page as

2984
02:14:17,239 --> 02:14:24,559
default so what we can do is say

2985
02:14:20,040 --> 02:14:27,679
export we can do this wrap this oops

2986
02:14:24,559 --> 02:14:31,559
wrap this in curly

2987
02:14:27,679 --> 02:14:35,000
braces and say job page

2988
02:14:31,559 --> 02:14:37,880
as default and then have a comma and

2989
02:14:35,000 --> 02:14:41,360
also export the job

2990
02:14:37,880 --> 02:14:44,760
loader now what we can do is go into the

2991
02:14:41,360 --> 02:14:47,800
app for uh app jsx where we're embedding

2992
02:14:44,760 --> 02:14:50,639
the job page and where we imported job

2993
02:14:47,800 --> 02:14:52,559
page that's default so no curly braces

2994
02:14:50,639 --> 02:14:56,400
around that that but then we can also go

2995
02:14:52,559 --> 02:14:58,559
like this job loader CU we exported that

2996
02:14:56,400 --> 02:15:01,199
as well so now we have access to this

2997
02:14:58,559 --> 02:15:04,719
job loader and with react router we can

2998
02:15:01,199 --> 02:15:07,079
go down to where we have the route for

2999
02:15:04,719 --> 02:15:10,679
job page so we're going to put this in

3000
02:15:07,079 --> 02:15:13,760
the route not the not the job page um

3001
02:15:10,679 --> 02:15:16,639
component itself but in the route so

3002
02:15:13,760 --> 02:15:21,239
I'll go after element and then say

3003
02:15:16,639 --> 02:15:23,360
loader and set that to job loader like

3004
02:15:21,239 --> 02:15:25,400
that all right so now we're passing in a

3005
02:15:23,360 --> 02:15:27,280
loader now the way that we access this

3006
02:15:25,400 --> 02:15:30,000
loader from in here from in our

3007
02:15:27,280 --> 02:15:31,599
component so we're exporting it from you

3008
02:15:30,000 --> 02:15:34,320
know from this function and then we're

3009
02:15:31,599 --> 02:15:36,960
passing it in to the route so the way

3010
02:15:34,320 --> 02:15:42,079
that we can access that is with the used

3011
02:15:36,960 --> 02:15:44,360
data load use loader data hook so use

3012
02:15:42,079 --> 02:15:47,040
loader data and that's going to be from

3013
02:15:44,360 --> 02:15:52,719
react router Dom and then all we have to

3014
02:15:47,040 --> 02:15:56,599
do is simply say const job set that to

3015
02:15:52,719 --> 02:15:58,040
use loader data like that and then I'm

3016
02:15:56,599 --> 02:16:01,920
going to

3017
02:15:58,040 --> 02:16:04,880
save let's come back over here let's see

3018
02:16:01,920 --> 02:16:06,599
loading is not defined so we're not

3019
02:16:04,880 --> 02:16:09,599
using loading anymore so I'm just going

3020
02:16:06,599 --> 02:16:12,159
to return the

3021
02:16:09,599 --> 02:16:14,480
H1 and there we go so you can see we're

3022
02:16:12,159 --> 02:16:16,000
actually getting the data but this time

3023
02:16:14,480 --> 02:16:18,239
it's actually coming in through that

3024
02:16:16,000 --> 02:16:21,159
loader we don't need the spinner either

3025
02:16:18,239 --> 02:16:23,719
so we cleared up this file quite a bit

3026
02:16:21,159 --> 02:16:26,360
and in addition to that this job loader

3027
02:16:23,719 --> 02:16:31,400
we can pass into other components as

3028
02:16:26,360 --> 02:16:31,400
well and use that to get a job by its

3029
02:16:34,479 --> 02:16:40,639
ID now let's finish up this page so I'm

3030
02:16:38,439 --> 02:16:44,559
going to go to my

3031
02:16:40,639 --> 02:16:47,639
theme and it's going to be the job. HTML

3032
02:16:44,559 --> 02:16:49,359
file and there's quite a bit here so

3033
02:16:47,639 --> 02:16:51,399
let's see we have this section with the

3034
02:16:49,359 --> 02:16:52,880
go back button

3035
02:16:51,399 --> 02:16:55,800
and then this section so I'm going to

3036
02:16:52,880 --> 02:16:55,800
grabb both of these

3037
02:16:57,160 --> 02:17:03,479
sections okay we're going to grab both

3038
02:16:59,080 --> 02:17:06,559
of those and then we want to return

3039
02:17:03,479 --> 02:17:11,280
here um we're going to return

3040
02:17:06,559 --> 02:17:13,359
a fragment with both of those sections

3041
02:17:11,280 --> 02:17:18,240
and then let's not forget to change all

3042
02:17:13,359 --> 02:17:22,760
the classes to class name and then any

3043
02:17:18,240 --> 02:17:26,399
comments like sidebar right here comment

3044
02:17:22,760 --> 02:17:30,000
that out uh we can get rid of

3045
02:17:26,399 --> 02:17:30,000
that get rid of

3046
02:17:30,840 --> 02:17:37,040
that and is that

3047
02:17:33,719 --> 02:17:39,920
it I think so so let's save all right so

3048
02:17:37,040 --> 02:17:41,399
now we just have just hardcoded data

3049
02:17:39,920 --> 02:17:44,960
right so we need to replace this with

3050
02:17:41,399 --> 02:17:48,639
Dynamic data also we have an icon right

3051
02:17:44,960 --> 02:17:52,399
here for the the fa Arrow left so let's

3052
02:17:48,639 --> 02:17:55,120
bring that in from

3053
02:17:52,399 --> 02:18:00,519
say fa

3054
02:17:55,120 --> 02:18:00,519
Arrow left and we're going to replace

3055
02:18:01,359 --> 02:18:08,160
this with fa Arrow

3056
02:18:04,599 --> 02:18:11,559
left and let's add a class

3057
02:18:08,160 --> 02:18:15,000
name uh we're going to do margin right

3058
02:18:11,559 --> 02:18:18,639
two and now we have our arrow and then

3059
02:18:15,000 --> 02:18:18,639
as far as the link we need to bring

3060
02:18:19,040 --> 02:18:26,920
in link

3061
02:18:22,319 --> 02:18:31,000
and change that to link change this to

3062
02:18:26,920 --> 02:18:34,160
two and change this to just slash jobs

3063
02:18:31,000 --> 02:18:35,920
so now the back button should work good

3064
02:18:34,160 --> 02:18:37,479
but notice they're all senior react

3065
02:18:35,920 --> 02:18:40,880
developer no matter what because they're

3066
02:18:37,479 --> 02:18:42,599
hardcoded but we have access to this job

3067
02:18:40,880 --> 02:18:45,479
object so we can simply replace

3068
02:18:42,599 --> 02:18:50,319
everything so like right here full time

3069
02:18:45,479 --> 02:18:53,960
let's change that to job. type all right

3070
02:18:50,319 --> 02:18:56,120
let's change that um this is going to be

3071
02:18:53,960 --> 02:18:59,200
the job.

3072
02:18:56,120 --> 02:19:02,519
tile okay now we get frontend

3073
02:18:59,200 --> 02:19:04,599
engineer we do have another icon here

3074
02:19:02,519 --> 02:19:06,960
which I believe we're going to use the

3075
02:19:04,599 --> 02:19:10,519
map

3076
02:19:06,960 --> 02:19:15,280
marker for that um yeah let's let's

3077
02:19:10,519 --> 02:19:17,240
bring in FA

3078
02:19:15,280 --> 02:19:21,719
map

3079
02:19:17,240 --> 02:19:24,719
marker and let's replace this

3080
02:19:21,719 --> 02:19:24,719
fa

3081
02:19:24,800 --> 02:19:28,679
map and let's see what that looks like

3082
02:19:27,319 --> 02:19:33,120
yeah so we want

3083
02:19:28,679 --> 02:19:35,000
to give that let's say class name text-

3084
02:19:33,120 --> 02:19:39,160
orang

3085
02:19:35,000 --> 02:19:39,160
d700 and margin right

3086
02:19:39,880 --> 02:19:44,160
two or margin right one

3087
02:19:44,319 --> 02:19:49,520
maybe yeah that's good enough okay so

3088
02:19:47,359 --> 02:19:51,280
underneath that this Boston Mass we're

3089
02:19:49,520 --> 02:19:53,160
going to change that

3090
02:19:51,280 --> 02:19:55,120
to

3091
02:19:53,160 --> 02:19:58,800
job.

3092
02:19:55,120 --> 02:19:58,800
location we have the

3093
02:19:59,920 --> 02:20:06,840
description job dot

3094
02:20:04,120 --> 02:20:09,240
description salary so this right here

3095
02:20:06,840 --> 02:20:11,280
we're going to replace that

3096
02:20:09,240 --> 02:20:13,920
job.

3097
02:20:11,280 --> 02:20:16,280
salary now in the sidebar we have the

3098
02:20:13,920 --> 02:20:19,640

3099
02:20:16,280 --> 02:20:22,720

02:20:27,760 --> 02:20:32,359
job.

3103
02:20:30,160 --> 02:20:33,920

3104
02:20:32,359 --> 02:20:36,680

3107
02:20:39,960 --> 02:20:48,000
the company description so that's going

3108
02:20:42,040 --> 02:20:50,680
to be job. company dot

3109
02:20:48,000 --> 02:20:55,319
description and then we get the contacta

3110
02:20:50,680 --> 02:21:01,280

3111
02:20:55,319 --> 02:21:05,120

phone so that's going to be job company

3114
02:21:09,800 --> 02:21:15,720

3115
02:21:12,960 --> 02:21:18,280
stuff is now coming from our back

3116
02:21:15,720 --> 02:21:20,359
end and then what do we have down here

3117
02:21:18,280 --> 02:21:23,720
we have the edit and delete so the edit

3118
02:21:20,359 --> 02:21:27,040
is a link so let's change that to link

3119
02:21:23,720 --> 02:21:30,040
let's change this to two and then as far

3120
02:21:27,040 --> 02:21:33,200
as the link itself let's make this

3121
02:21:30,040 --> 02:21:37,720
Dynamic with some back ticks because we

3122
02:21:33,200 --> 02:21:41,600
want this to go to slash jobs sledit

3123
02:21:37,720 --> 02:21:44,560
slash and then the job.

3124
02:21:41,600 --> 02:21:47,319
ID and we'll handle that later and the

3125
02:21:44,560 --> 02:21:49,880
button we'll just leave that as is for

3126
02:21:47,319 --> 02:21:53,080
now and there we go so now whatever we

3127
02:21:49,880 --> 02:21:54,880
click on we can see the actual data and

3128
02:21:53,080 --> 02:21:57,160
let's make sure we're not getting

3129
02:21:54,880 --> 02:21:59,920
any

3130
02:21:57,160 --> 02:22:02,479
errors cool so we now have our single

3131
02:21:59,920 --> 02:22:04,720
pages so now we're going to do the the

3132
02:22:02,479 --> 02:22:09,280
add job page which right now doesn't

3133
02:22:04,720 --> 02:22:14,479
exist so let's create the page so under

3134
02:22:09,280 --> 02:22:14,479
Pages we'll say add job

3135
02:22:15,600 --> 02:22:19,359
page and let's add the

3136
02:22:19,520 --> 02:22:25,160
route so we want to import add job page

3137
02:22:23,280 --> 02:22:28,200
and then we're going to put this uh I'll

3138
02:22:25,160 --> 02:22:32,880
just copy this down change this to add

3139
02:22:28,200 --> 02:22:36,359
job page and then the path is going to

3140
02:22:32,880 --> 02:22:39,439
be add Dash

3141
02:22:36,359 --> 02:22:41,439
job okay so now if you click on ADD job

3142
02:22:39,439 --> 02:22:44,359
you should see that also this button

3143
02:22:41,439 --> 02:22:47,640
here should also go to the add job

3144
02:22:44,359 --> 02:22:52,000
page all right now we need to get the

3145
02:22:47,640 --> 02:22:54,920
form so let's go to the theme file

3146
02:22:52,000 --> 02:22:56,960
so this is ADD job. HTML and what we're

3147
02:22:54,920 --> 02:22:59,439
going to do is get the whole section

3148
02:22:56,960 --> 02:23:01,280
right here that has the form in it so

3149
02:22:59,439 --> 02:23:05,560
just grab this entire

3150
02:23:01,280 --> 02:23:06,800
thing and let's paste this in the return

3151
02:23:05,560 --> 02:23:09,319
so right here we're going to have

3152
02:23:06,800 --> 02:23:11,200
parentheses and then paste that in now

3153
02:23:09,319 --> 02:23:16,000
we have to change all the instances of

3154
02:23:11,200 --> 02:23:17,720
class so command shift L class name also

3155
02:23:16,000 --> 02:23:19,960
these have labels with the four

3156
02:23:17,720 --> 02:23:22,439
attribute which isn't allowed in jsx we

3157
02:23:19,960 --> 02:23:25,080
need to change it to HTML 4 so I'm going

3158
02:23:22,439 --> 02:23:26,680
to select the four equal not just four

3159
02:23:25,080 --> 02:23:29,680
CU I'm sure there's other things in here

3160
02:23:26,680 --> 02:23:32,000
that have F so select the equal sign as

3161
02:23:29,680 --> 02:23:35,800
well select all of them and then change

3162
02:23:32,000 --> 02:23:40,240
it to HTML uppercase R4 I mean uppercase

3163
02:23:35,800 --> 02:23:42,840
F for save it and now we have our

3164
02:23:40,240 --> 02:23:45,760
form now there's many ways to work with

3165
02:23:42,840 --> 02:23:47,680
forms there's other libraries like foric

3166
02:23:45,760 --> 02:23:50,120
um there's there's a lot of things you

3167
02:23:47,680 --> 02:23:53,439
can do you can use refs but the I'd say

3168
02:23:50,120 --> 02:23:57,040
the the common way the core way of doing

3169
02:23:53,439 --> 02:24:00,160
it is adding a piece of State for every

3170
02:23:57,040 --> 02:24:02,120
field in your form okay because the

3171
02:24:00,160 --> 02:24:03,960
these change and then when you when you

3172
02:24:02,120 --> 02:24:07,760
change it when you type in it or you

3173
02:24:03,960 --> 02:24:09,240
select you change the state of that item

3174
02:24:07,760 --> 02:24:11,680
okay

3175
02:24:09,240 --> 02:24:13,160
so what we're going to do is bring in

3176
02:24:11,680 --> 02:24:16,800
add

3177
02:24:13,160 --> 02:24:21,840
State uh you sorry use State add state

3178
02:24:16,800 --> 02:24:25,160
so let's import use state

3179
02:24:21,840 --> 02:24:27,240
and then we want to create a state item

3180
02:24:25,160 --> 02:24:30,000
for each field now there's different

3181
02:24:27,240 --> 02:24:32,600
ways you can do this you could have just

3182
02:24:30,000 --> 02:24:34,600
a single object in your state and have

3183
02:24:32,600 --> 02:24:36,479
all the fields in that object or you can

3184
02:24:34,600 --> 02:24:38,520
do a separate piece of State for every

3185
02:24:36,479 --> 02:24:41,920
field which is what I'm going to do just

3186
02:24:38,520 --> 02:24:44,439
to keep it simple so let's say con we

3187
02:24:41,920 --> 02:24:48,399
know we have a title so title and then

3188
02:24:44,439 --> 02:24:51,479
set title to change it and set that to

3189
02:24:48,399 --> 02:24:53,720
use state and then in here is going to

3190
02:24:51,479 --> 02:24:54,920
be the defaults and most of these

3191
02:24:53,720 --> 02:24:57,880
actually all these are just going to be

3192
02:24:54,920 --> 02:25:00,319
empty strings as default now I'm going

3193
02:24:57,880 --> 02:25:01,720
to just copy this down actually you know

3194
02:25:00,319 --> 02:25:05,800
what I'm going to paste the rest of

3195
02:25:01,720 --> 02:25:09,560
these in and then you can just copy

3196
02:25:05,800 --> 02:25:12,840
them okay so we have title type location

3197
02:25:09,560 --> 02:25:16,319
description salary company name company

3198
02:25:12,840 --> 02:25:18,880

02:25:16,319 --> 02:25:21,479
phone all right so those that those are

3200
02:25:18,880 --> 02:25:24,319
all the state and and what we need to do

3201
02:25:21,479 --> 02:25:27,200
now is add on each

3202
02:25:24,319 --> 02:25:30,880
input so let's see the first one is the

3203
02:25:27,200 --> 02:25:33,840
select it's the type so this select

3204
02:25:30,880 --> 02:25:34,760
right here and what we want to do is add

3205
02:25:33,840 --> 02:25:38,680
a

3206
02:25:34,760 --> 02:25:42,040
value and set that value to that piece

3207
02:25:38,680 --> 02:25:45,439
of state which in our case is called

3208
02:25:42,040 --> 02:25:47,399
type okay so if I save that and I come

3209
02:25:45,439 --> 02:25:49,960
over here and I try to change it notice

3210
02:25:47,399 --> 02:25:51,680
it doesn't work it doesn't do anything

3211
02:25:49,960 --> 02:25:54,000
and if if I look at the console it's

3212
02:25:51,680 --> 02:25:56,520
going to tell me I provided a value prop

3213
02:25:54,000 --> 02:26:00,080
to a form field without an onchange

3214
02:25:56,520 --> 02:26:02,080
Handler so basically when you add a

3215
02:26:00,080 --> 02:26:04,279
piece of state to or you connect a piece

3216
02:26:02,080 --> 02:26:06,520
of state to an input you have to add an

3217
02:26:04,279 --> 02:26:10,560
onchange because when you change it that

3218
02:26:06,520 --> 02:26:14,160
state has to update and has to call this

3219
02:26:10,560 --> 02:26:16,800
set type or set whatever the field is so

3220
02:26:14,160 --> 02:26:19,160
what we can do is under the value we're

3221
02:26:16,800 --> 02:26:21,000
going to say onchange so just like any

3222
02:26:19,160 --> 02:26:24,920
other event on click or whatever you

3223
02:26:21,000 --> 02:26:29,960
just add it camel case and what we'll do

3224
02:26:24,920 --> 02:26:33,520
is set a function and this can take in

3225
02:26:29,960 --> 02:26:37,479
an an event param okay now this

3226
02:26:33,520 --> 02:26:38,920
parameter has on it uh a target. value

3227
02:26:37,479 --> 02:26:41,439
and that's going to be whatever is

3228
02:26:38,920 --> 02:26:43,640
selected or typed in the field so what

3229
02:26:41,439 --> 02:26:45,640
we can do is then say well we want to

3230
02:26:43,640 --> 02:26:50,760
set the

3231
02:26:45,640 --> 02:26:53,359
type and we want to set it to e. Target

3232
02:26:50,760 --> 02:26:55,399
do value because this is going to be

3233
02:26:53,359 --> 02:26:59,319
whatever I select and I'm going to set

3234
02:26:55,399 --> 02:27:02,439
the state to that so now if I save that

3235
02:26:59,319 --> 02:27:05,520
reload and I click on part-time now it

3236
02:27:02,439 --> 02:27:06,520
works and if we look in our components

3237
02:27:05,520 --> 02:27:09,520
in the dev

3238
02:27:06,520 --> 02:27:12,600
tools now we have a bunch of stuff here

3239
02:27:09,520 --> 02:27:14,920
if we look at the add job page and we

3240
02:27:12,600 --> 02:27:17,640
look in the state where it says part

3241
02:27:14,920 --> 02:27:20,560
time if I change that to fulltime you'll

3242
02:27:17,640 --> 02:27:23,720
see that the State updates okay okay so

3243
02:27:20,560 --> 02:27:26,279
now this input is part of the component

3244
02:27:23,720 --> 02:27:28,760
state so we need to do that for all the

3245
02:27:26,279 --> 02:27:31,520
inputs so let's actually copy the value

3246
02:27:28,760 --> 02:27:34,200
and the on change here and go to the

3247
02:27:31,520 --> 02:27:37,319
next one which is the title I know this

3248
02:27:34,200 --> 02:27:38,960
says name but it's the field is title so

3249
02:27:37,319 --> 02:27:42,439
we're going to paste that in and then

3250
02:27:38,960 --> 02:27:46,560
change that and that to title okay and

3251
02:27:42,439 --> 02:27:48,439
make sure that you this is uppercase if

3252
02:27:46,560 --> 02:27:50,640
if you selected both and changed them at

3253
02:27:48,439 --> 02:27:52,880
the same time then this is probably

3254
02:27:50,640 --> 02:27:55,080
going to be lowercase so you can

3255
02:27:52,880 --> 02:27:57,800
manually change it to uppercase or what

3256
02:27:55,080 --> 02:28:00,600
I would recommend is using this multiple

3257
02:27:57,800 --> 02:28:02,439
case preserve extension and it'll

3258
02:28:00,600 --> 02:28:04,560
basically just preserve your case if

3259
02:28:02,439 --> 02:28:07,359
you're changing a bunch of stuff at once

3260
02:28:04,560 --> 02:28:09,800
so really comes in handy it's it's a

3261
02:28:07,359 --> 02:28:10,680
small extension pretty unknown but it's

3262
02:28:09,800 --> 02:28:13,080
very

3263
02:28:10,680 --> 02:28:14,920
useful all right so now description

3264
02:28:13,080 --> 02:28:18,960
that's the placeholder um the

3265
02:28:14,920 --> 02:28:20,120
placeholder that's the the text area and

3266
02:28:18,960 --> 02:28:23,840
we're going to go ahead and just change

3267
02:28:20,120 --> 02:28:23,840
change that and that to

3268
02:28:24,040 --> 02:28:27,880
description okay so it's just setting

3269
02:28:26,080 --> 02:28:30,960
that description state to whatever I

3270
02:28:27,880 --> 02:28:33,160
type in on change every time I type in

3271
02:28:30,960 --> 02:28:35,800
anything salary let's see this is

3272
02:28:33,160 --> 02:28:40,680
another select so let's paste that in

3273
02:28:35,800 --> 02:28:40,680
and change that and that to

3274
02:28:40,800 --> 02:28:49,040
salary okay then we have

3275
02:28:44,880 --> 02:28:52,040
location so we're going to do this this

3276
02:28:49,040 --> 02:28:52,040
location

3277
02:28:53,760 --> 02:28:59,520
name change

3278
02:28:56,520 --> 02:28:59,520
that

3279
02:28:59,560 --> 02:29:03,880
company

3280
02:29:01,200 --> 02:29:06,080
name and set company name then we have

3281
02:29:03,880 --> 02:29:06,080
the

3282
02:29:08,800 --> 02:29:14,640
description so this is company

3283
02:29:12,200 --> 02:29:17,200
description whoops it should be

3284
02:29:14,640 --> 02:29:19,560
set company

3285
02:29:17,200 --> 02:29:22,040
description then we have the contact

3286
02:29:19,560 --> 02:29:22,040
email

3287
02:29:27,840 --> 02:29:35,120
now again make sure you're changing this

3288
02:29:30,279 --> 02:29:35,120
too not just the value and then for the

3289
02:29:37,120 --> 02:29:42,880
phone contact

3290
02:29:40,920 --> 02:29:45,640
phone

3291
02:29:42,880 --> 02:29:49,040
oops Yeah would just double

3292
02:29:45,640 --> 02:29:52,160
check double check all

3293
02:29:49,040 --> 02:29:54,479
those all right so I think that that

3294
02:29:52,160 --> 02:29:56,600
should do it as far as adding the state

3295
02:29:54,479 --> 02:29:59,560
for each of these you should be able to

3296
02:29:56,600 --> 02:30:02,240
you know change these up type in here

3297
02:29:59,560 --> 02:30:03,760
and it's changing the state of you know

3298
02:30:02,240 --> 02:30:07,479
those

3299
02:30:03,760 --> 02:30:11,600
fields um now we want to submit the form

3300
02:30:07,479 --> 02:30:11,600
so let's come up to the form

3301
02:30:12,240 --> 02:30:17,720
tag now they just react 19 is going to

3302
02:30:15,640 --> 02:30:19,720
have something called actions where you

3303
02:30:17,720 --> 02:30:22,680
can actually put an action and set that

3304
02:30:19,720 --> 02:30:25,160
to function that's a a brand new way of

3305
02:30:22,680 --> 02:30:27,600
doing it in react 19 that isn't even

3306
02:30:25,160 --> 02:30:29,319
released yet so we're going to stick to

3307
02:30:27,600 --> 02:30:32,880
just adding an

3308
02:30:29,319 --> 02:30:34,319
onsubmit and set that to now now up to

3309
02:30:32,880 --> 02:30:36,080
this point where we have events we've

3310
02:30:34,319 --> 02:30:39,720
been putting the function directly in

3311
02:30:36,080 --> 02:30:42,840
here but we can set it to uh a function

3312
02:30:39,720 --> 02:30:46,000
that we create so let's say we want it

3313
02:30:42,840 --> 02:30:48,920
to be called sub uh we'll call it

3314
02:30:46,000 --> 02:30:53,479
onsubmit uh no let's call

3315
02:30:48,920 --> 02:30:55,960
it submit form and then we can create

3316
02:30:53,479 --> 02:31:00,600
that function up here I'm going to go

3317
02:30:55,960 --> 02:31:03,200
above the return con submit form and I

3318
02:31:00,600 --> 02:31:05,000
like Arrow functions you don't have to

3319
02:31:03,200 --> 02:31:07,040
do this you can use a regular function

3320
02:31:05,000 --> 02:31:08,880
if you want and that's going to take in

3321
02:31:07,040 --> 02:31:12,359
an event parameter because we want to

3322
02:31:08,880 --> 02:31:14,200
stop the default Behavior so we can do e

3323
02:31:12,359 --> 02:31:17,760
do and this is just like with vanilla

3324
02:31:14,200 --> 02:31:20,720
JavaScript so prevent

3325
02:31:17,760 --> 02:31:22,960
default and then let's do a console log

3326
02:31:20,720 --> 02:31:24,160
and we should have access to all the the

3327
02:31:22,960 --> 02:31:26,120
state right because they're all

3328
02:31:24,160 --> 02:31:27,720
connected to those fields so for

3329
02:31:26,120 --> 02:31:30,319
instance if I put

3330
02:31:27,720 --> 02:31:33,160
in uh let's say

3331
02:31:30,319 --> 02:31:37,240
description if I console log description

3332
02:31:33,160 --> 02:31:40,600
right come over here let's open up the

3333
02:31:37,240 --> 02:31:41,840
console and just make sure okay and then

3334
02:31:40,600 --> 02:31:44,880
I'm just going to put something in the

3335
02:31:41,840 --> 02:31:46,960
description and I'm going to submit the

3336
02:31:44,880 --> 02:31:48,840
form all right so we do have some

3337
02:31:46,960 --> 02:31:51,840
required

3338
02:31:48,840 --> 02:31:56,760
fields

3339
02:31:51,840 --> 02:31:56,760
let's see is that it oh this is required

3340
02:31:57,920 --> 02:32:02,279
too okay so now I submitted and what I

3341
02:32:01,000 --> 02:32:05,000
had in the

3342
02:32:02,279 --> 02:32:06,840
description right here is now logging so

3343
02:32:05,000 --> 02:32:09,040
we know that the forms hooked up to this

3344
02:32:06,840 --> 02:32:10,439
event this submit Handler and we know

3345
02:32:09,040 --> 02:32:13,880
that we can access at least the

3346
02:32:10,439 --> 02:32:16,160
description field so let's construct an

3347
02:32:13,880 --> 02:32:19,479
object from the form fields that we want

3348
02:32:16,160 --> 02:32:23,760
to submit to our API so I'm going to say

3349
02:32:19,479 --> 02:32:26,279
con new job set that to an object and we

3350
02:32:23,760 --> 02:32:29,120
want to set the title and since I'm

3351
02:32:26,279 --> 02:32:30,600
setting title to title like this we

3352
02:32:29,120 --> 02:32:32,760
don't need the second one we can just

3353
02:32:30,600 --> 02:32:36,000
simply do that

3354
02:32:32,760 --> 02:32:36,000
type um

3355
02:32:36,640 --> 02:32:42,240
location

3356
02:32:39,120 --> 02:32:45,240
description we have the

3357
02:32:42,240 --> 02:32:47,920
salary now this is where cuz we we need

3358
02:32:45,240 --> 02:32:49,920
this to match up with the way our API is

3359
02:32:47,920 --> 02:32:52,880
structured so now we're going to have

3360
02:32:49,920 --> 02:32:59,479
have our company

3361
02:32:52,880 --> 02:33:02,920

same thing so we can keep it like that

3368
02:33:18,080 --> 02:33:23,960
and then contact phone all right and

3369
02:33:21,439 --> 02:33:26,080
then let's just console log this new job

02:33:47,319 --> 02:33:51,720
lists looks like those aren't showing

3379
02:33:52,439 --> 02:33:58,800
up okay now it did salary type all right

3380
02:33:56,399 --> 02:33:58,800
so that

3381
02:33:59,800 --> 02:34:07,359
did um I just want to make sure if I

3382
02:34:03,640 --> 02:34:09,640
don't if I leave the defaults for salary

3383
02:34:07,359 --> 02:34:09,640
those

3384
02:34:11,439 --> 02:34:17,359
should those should show the default

3385
02:34:14,840 --> 02:34:21,720
values which they're

3386
02:34:17,359 --> 02:34:21,720
not they're blank

3387
02:34:22,760 --> 02:34:28,200
um all right so you know what we can do

3388
02:34:25,479 --> 02:34:30,120
is set the defaults for those since

3389
02:34:28,200 --> 02:34:33,080
there's select lists for the type for

3390
02:34:30,120 --> 02:34:36,080
instance let's say under what's the

3391
02:34:33,080 --> 02:34:39,520
default if we look at the options

3392
02:34:36,080 --> 02:34:42,840
here oh for for Sal uh not salary for

3393
02:34:39,520 --> 02:34:45,160
the type this is the default

3394
02:34:42,840 --> 02:34:48,000
fulltime

3395
02:34:45,160 --> 02:34:50,800
so um for the type that's going to be

3396
02:34:48,000 --> 02:34:52,760
full-time and then

3397
02:34:50,800 --> 02:34:55,920
for

3398
02:34:52,760 --> 02:34:59,080
salary let's make this it has to be the

3399
02:34:55,920 --> 02:35:02,600
same exact as

3400
02:34:59,080 --> 02:35:05,840
this so we'll set that as the

3401
02:35:02,600 --> 02:35:08,960
default for the salary so let's see if I

3402
02:35:05,840 --> 02:35:10,640
reload that and then we submit this

3403
02:35:08,960 --> 02:35:14,240
again I know this is kind of a pain to

3404
02:35:10,640 --> 02:35:14,240
have to fill these in

3405
02:35:15,960 --> 02:35:22,240
again all right so

3406
02:35:18,640 --> 02:35:25,880
now yep under 50K for the salary and

3407
02:35:22,240 --> 02:35:29,479
fulltime for the type so our submission

3408
02:35:25,880 --> 02:35:32,520
is working now we need to make our

3409
02:35:29,479 --> 02:35:36,479
request our post request to the back end

3410
02:35:32,520 --> 02:35:40,800
so for that we could do that here right

3411
02:35:36,479 --> 02:35:43,399
but I like to have requests like that

3412
02:35:40,800 --> 02:35:46,760
all in the same place so I actually want

3413
02:35:43,399 --> 02:35:50,319
it in the main app file the edit the

3414
02:35:46,760 --> 02:35:51,920
delete and the add or the submit so what

3415
02:35:50,319 --> 02:35:56,120
we can do

3416
02:35:51,920 --> 02:35:59,520
is pass in let's see so right here as a

3417
02:35:56,120 --> 02:36:02,200
prop we can pass in a function so we'll

3418
02:35:59,520 --> 02:36:03,680
we'll say um what do we want to call

3419
02:36:02,200 --> 02:36:06,960
this

3420
02:36:03,680 --> 02:36:09,520
add add job

3421
02:36:06,960 --> 02:36:11,680
submit and then we can call that

3422
02:36:09,520 --> 02:36:16,600
function down here let's replace the

3423
02:36:11,680 --> 02:36:19,120
console log with ADD job

3424
02:36:16,600 --> 02:36:24,080
submit and once we submit it I actually

3425
02:36:19,120 --> 02:36:27,319
want to redirect to the jobs page so to

3426
02:36:24,080 --> 02:36:29,800
redirect we can use use navigate the use

3427
02:36:27,319 --> 02:36:31,000
navigate Hook from react router Dom so

3428
02:36:29,800 --> 02:36:34,359
let's say

3429
02:36:31,000 --> 02:36:38,319
import use

3430
02:36:34,359 --> 02:36:41,560
navigate and that's going to be

3431
02:36:38,319 --> 02:36:43,439
from react router Dom now to use this we

3432
02:36:41,560 --> 02:36:45,279
need to First initialize it so I'm going

3433
02:36:43,439 --> 02:36:51,479
to go right here below the state and

3434
02:36:45,279 --> 02:36:54,800
just say const navigate set that to use

3435
02:36:51,479 --> 02:36:58,920
navigate and then after we submit I'm

3436
02:36:54,800 --> 02:37:01,520
just going to Simply return

3437
02:36:58,920 --> 02:37:03,000
navigate and then where we where we want

3438
02:37:01,520 --> 02:37:05,520
this to redirect which is going to be

3439
02:37:03,000 --> 02:37:05,520
slash

3440
02:37:06,240 --> 02:37:14,080
jobs okay so this add job submit this is

3441
02:37:10,840 --> 02:37:17,560
being passed in now as a prop so in our

3442
02:37:14,080 --> 02:37:21,240
app let's go to the component which is

3443
02:37:17,560 --> 02:37:23,920
the add job page and let's say add job

3444
02:37:21,240 --> 02:37:26,760
submit and what we'll do is set this to

3445
02:37:23,920 --> 02:37:29,920
a function called add job and then we

3446
02:37:26,760 --> 02:37:33,359
can create that here so we'll say

3447
02:37:29,920 --> 02:37:33,359
const add

3448
02:37:33,479 --> 02:37:40,439
job okay and that's going to take

3449
02:37:36,560 --> 02:37:42,720
in the new job and just to make sure

3450
02:37:40,439 --> 02:37:45,279
this is working we'll do a console log

3451
02:37:42,720 --> 02:37:45,279
of new

3452
02:37:47,279 --> 02:37:51,479
job all right

3453
02:37:49,560 --> 02:37:54,800
[Music]

3454
02:37:51,479 --> 02:37:58,120
uh actually you know

3455
02:37:54,800 --> 02:38:01,240
what this should be in the app

3456
02:37:58,120 --> 02:38:03,560
component and I'm going to move the

3457
02:38:01,240 --> 02:38:05,319
router into that as well yeah let's do

3458
02:38:03,560 --> 02:38:08,160
that let's move this

3459
02:38:05,319 --> 02:38:11,479
stuff into the app component I meant to

3460
02:38:08,160 --> 02:38:14,359
put that in here to begin with okay so

3461
02:38:11,479 --> 02:38:15,680
that should still work now let's fill

3462
02:38:14,359 --> 02:38:18,439
out this form

3463
02:38:15,680 --> 02:38:21,439
again paint in the ass

3464
02:38:18,439 --> 02:38:21,439
form

3465
02:38:24,479 --> 02:38:29,319
all right so if I submit it it

3466
02:38:26,720 --> 02:38:32,000
redirected to the jobs page and it

3467
02:38:29,319 --> 02:38:34,080
showed it in the console so that means

3468
02:38:32,000 --> 02:38:36,240
that it's calling this right you can

3469
02:38:34,080 --> 02:38:39,479
even see it in my my editor using

3470
02:38:36,240 --> 02:38:42,800
console ninja and then it it redirected

3471
02:38:39,479 --> 02:38:45,760
us because of this

3472
02:38:42,800 --> 02:38:48,399
so if you want to if you want to call a

3473
02:38:45,760 --> 02:38:51,560
function in a parent component you can

3474
02:38:48,399 --> 02:38:54,560
do that you just pass it down like this

3475
02:38:51,560 --> 02:38:57,080
right so I passed in this add job I

3476
02:38:54,560 --> 02:39:00,760
passed that in as a value to add job

3477
02:38:57,080 --> 02:39:03,240
submit and then in this in this page I

3478
02:39:00,760 --> 02:39:04,160
caught add job submit and I called it

3479
02:39:03,240 --> 02:39:07,479
right

3480
02:39:04,160 --> 02:39:09,520
here so I mean that that kind of

3481
02:39:07,479 --> 02:39:12,080
confused me when I was learning this

3482
02:39:09,520 --> 02:39:14,520
because it's it's just a little weird to

3483
02:39:12,080 --> 02:39:17,160
know am I passing this up am I passing

3484
02:39:14,520 --> 02:39:18,960
it down like it's a little confusing at

3485
02:39:17,160 --> 02:39:21,760
least it was to me but just know you can

3486
02:39:18,960 --> 02:39:25,560
pass in a function and you can call that

3487
02:39:21,760 --> 02:39:27,359
function and um whatever you put here so

3488
02:39:25,560 --> 02:39:30,920
add job for instance is going to get

3489
02:39:27,359 --> 02:39:34,040
fired off whenever you fire this off in

3490
02:39:30,920 --> 02:39:36,720
this component or this page so now that

3491
02:39:34,040 --> 02:39:38,680
we've done that we should be able to to

3492
02:39:36,720 --> 02:39:41,680
make the request and actually add the

3493
02:39:38,680 --> 02:39:46,200
job so let's get rid of the console log

3494
02:39:41,680 --> 02:39:49,560
and let's say cons res set that to

3495
02:39:46,200 --> 02:39:51,279
await uh await fetch which means we have

3496
02:39:49,560 --> 02:39:53,920
to make this

3497
02:39:51,279 --> 02:39:56,200
asynchronous so

3498
02:39:53,920 --> 02:40:01,000
async and then we're going to fetch

3499
02:39:56,200 --> 02:40:02,720
let's say slash API SL jobs but this is

3500
02:40:01,000 --> 02:40:06,680
going to be a post request so we need to

3501
02:40:02,720 --> 02:40:10,319
pass in a second object and set the

3502
02:40:06,680 --> 02:40:13,000
method to

3503
02:40:10,319 --> 02:40:13,960
post okay and then we also want to set

3504
02:40:13,000 --> 02:40:16,840
the

3505
02:40:13,960 --> 02:40:19,439
headers oops

3506
02:40:16,840 --> 02:40:22,760
headers and that's going to be an object

3507
02:40:19,439 --> 02:40:24,040
and we want to specify the content type

3508
02:40:22,760 --> 02:40:26,640
so

3509
02:40:24,040 --> 02:40:29,200
content-type which is going to be

3510
02:40:26,640 --> 02:40:31,960
application slash

3511
02:40:29,200 --> 02:40:34,479
Json and then the data itself is going

3512
02:40:31,960 --> 02:40:38,560
to go under the headers in the body

3513
02:40:34,479 --> 02:40:38,560
we're going to wrap it in json.stringify

3514
02:40:38,640 --> 02:40:45,760
and pass in that new job and then after

3515
02:40:43,160 --> 02:40:50,240
that will'll just

3516
02:40:45,760 --> 02:40:53,319
return so let's save that and then

3517
02:40:50,240 --> 02:40:55,560
let's come over here go to add job we'll

3518
02:40:53,319 --> 02:40:59,120
just say test job

3519
02:40:55,560 --> 02:40:59,120
one this is a

3520
02:41:02,840 --> 02:41:06,319
test company

3521
02:41:09,600 --> 02:41:15,479
name this is an awesome

3522
02:41:18,240 --> 02:41:22,600
company

3523
02:41:21,080 --> 02:41:25,880
all right so we're going to go ahead and

3524
02:41:22,600 --> 02:41:29,960
click add job and it redirected us to

3525
02:41:25,880 --> 02:41:32,600
the job page and we have our new

3526
02:41:29,960 --> 02:41:35,279
job all right so it made the post

3527
02:41:32,600 --> 02:41:38,240
requests and it we just returned from

3528
02:41:35,279 --> 02:41:41,080
this function but we redirected in this

3529
02:41:38,240 --> 02:41:44,080
one to jobs and if I click read more it

3530
02:41:41,080 --> 02:41:46,960
takes me to the single page for that new

3531
02:41:44,080 --> 02:41:49,080
job so now let's do the delete so I want

3532
02:41:46,960 --> 02:41:51,439
to be able to click this delete button

3533
02:41:49,080 --> 02:41:54,040
and and again I want that the actual

3534
02:41:51,439 --> 02:41:56,359
request function to be in the main app

3535
02:41:54,040 --> 02:41:59,600
component so let's put a comment here

3536
02:41:56,359 --> 02:42:03,240
we'll say add new job and then

3537
02:41:59,600 --> 02:42:05,200
underneath that add let's say

3538
02:42:03,240 --> 02:42:08,560
delete

3539
02:42:05,200 --> 02:42:11,560
job call this delete job and it's going

3540
02:42:08,560 --> 02:42:12,800
to be a sync it's going to take in an ID

3541
02:42:11,560 --> 02:42:14,920
because we need to know which one to

3542
02:42:12,800 --> 02:42:19,319
delete and then for now we'll do a

3543
02:42:14,920 --> 02:42:20,680
console log of delete and the ID and

3544
02:42:19,319 --> 02:42:24,080
that's going to get passed into the

3545
02:42:20,680 --> 02:42:28,920
single job page right here as a prop so

3546
02:42:24,080 --> 02:42:28,920
we'll say delete job set that

3547
02:42:29,439 --> 02:42:32,960
to delete

3548
02:42:34,240 --> 02:42:41,600
job yeah so we'll do that and then we

3549
02:42:37,040 --> 02:42:41,600
can pass that in as a prop to the job

3550
02:42:41,920 --> 02:42:50,560
page so right here I'll say delete

3551
02:42:47,640 --> 02:42:53,000
job and then on the

3552
02:42:50,560 --> 02:42:54,800
button at the bottom here we have this

3553
02:42:53,000 --> 02:42:58,640
button let's say

3554
02:42:54,800 --> 02:43:00,560
onclick and we're going to set that to a

3555
02:42:58,640 --> 02:43:04,680
function and then we'll we'll call

3556
02:43:00,560 --> 02:43:07,520
another function called on delete click

3557
02:43:04,680 --> 02:43:10,359
and then pass in the job.

3558
02:43:07,520 --> 02:43:14,160
ID okay and then this on delete click

3559
02:43:10,359 --> 02:43:14,160
we're going to put that up

3560
02:43:14,319 --> 02:43:21,120
here const on

3561
02:43:17,000 --> 02:43:21,120
delete click

3562
02:43:21,560 --> 02:43:27,760
and let's pass in uh we get the job ID

3563
02:43:25,600 --> 02:43:30,000
getting passed in here and I want a

3564
02:43:27,760 --> 02:43:31,600
confirmation since it's a delete so I'll

3565
02:43:30,000 --> 02:43:37,160
say cons

3566
02:43:31,600 --> 02:43:40,920
confirm set that to window do

3567
02:43:37,160 --> 02:43:43,760
confirm and we'll say are you

3568
02:43:40,920 --> 02:43:47,560
sure are you sure you

3569
02:43:43,760 --> 02:43:52,720
want to delete this

3570
02:43:47,560 --> 02:43:55,760
listing okay and then let's say if not

3571
02:43:52,720 --> 02:43:59,160
confirm then we want to just

3572
02:43:55,760 --> 02:44:02,479
return if we don't if we do

3573
02:43:59,160 --> 02:44:05,920
confirm then we're going to call that

3574
02:44:02,479 --> 02:44:09,279
delete job that we passed in and we want

3575
02:44:05,920 --> 02:44:13,800
to pass in the job ID okay and then I'm

3576
02:44:09,279 --> 02:44:16,640
going to um redirect so in order to do

3577
02:44:13,800 --> 02:44:18,640
that we have to bring in use

3578
02:44:16,640 --> 02:44:22,120
navigate so let's see that's going to

3579
02:44:18,640 --> 02:44:22,120
come in from react router

3580
02:44:23,960 --> 02:44:28,920
Dom and then we have to initialize it so

3581
02:44:31,279 --> 02:44:37,120
const like that and then we can

3582
02:44:35,359 --> 02:44:40,120
just

3583
02:44:37,120 --> 02:44:43,120
navigate to

3584
02:44:40,120 --> 02:44:43,120
slash

3585
02:44:43,840 --> 02:44:48,680
jobs all right now let's just click on

3586
02:44:47,319 --> 02:44:51,000
it and what should happen is it should

3587
02:44:48,680 --> 02:44:55,640
redirect irect us and it should show the

3588
02:44:51,000 --> 02:44:59,479
ID in the console so click it say Okay

3589
02:44:55,640 --> 02:45:02,319
redirects and shows the

3590
02:44:59,479 --> 02:45:05,319
ID is that the

3591
02:45:02,319 --> 02:45:07,920
ID see jobs. Json so it should have

3592
02:45:05,319 --> 02:45:11,720
added my test to the file yeah right

3593
02:45:07,920 --> 02:45:14,520
here so that is the ID for the test job

3594
02:45:11,720 --> 02:45:16,800
good so now we want to make the actual

3595
02:45:14,520 --> 02:45:19,240
request to the API so that's going to go

3596
02:45:16,800 --> 02:45:21,600
right here so we'll have all of our

3597
02:45:19,240 --> 02:45:24,680
requests in you know nice and neat in

3598
02:45:21,600 --> 02:45:27,520
this file now this is for a small

3599
02:45:24,680 --> 02:45:30,319
application you could use cont the

3600
02:45:27,520 --> 02:45:32,920
context API which you know you would

3601
02:45:30,319 --> 02:45:35,080
have it o in a in a context file you

3602
02:45:32,920 --> 02:45:37,120
could use Redux or some other state

3603
02:45:35,080 --> 02:45:39,160
manager but this is such a small

3604
02:45:37,120 --> 02:45:43,080
application we don't need

3605
02:45:39,160 --> 02:45:45,240
that so I'm going to just grab this from

3606
02:45:43,080 --> 02:45:48,319
the ad job and

3607
02:45:45,240 --> 02:45:51,439
then put that here okay we're going to

3608
02:45:48,319 --> 02:45:55,680
fetch API jobs now we have the ID coming

3609
02:45:51,439 --> 02:45:57,920
in so let's make this make these back

3610
02:45:55,680 --> 02:46:01,439
ticks and say

3611
02:45:57,920 --> 02:46:05,279
slash and then the

3612
02:46:01,439 --> 02:46:10,600
ID method is going to be

3613
02:46:05,279 --> 02:46:14,640
delete okay um headers get rid of

3614
02:46:10,600 --> 02:46:14,640
that and get rid of the

3615
02:46:15,240 --> 02:46:20,000
body

3616
02:46:17,359 --> 02:46:23,200
and yeah I mean that that

3617
02:46:20,000 --> 02:46:26,120
should should do it let's try that so

3618
02:46:23,200 --> 02:46:29,479
DET test job one delete are you sure

3619
02:46:26,120 --> 02:46:31,439
okay and now it's gone if I reload it's

3620
02:46:29,479 --> 02:46:33,040
gone and it should be gone from that

3621
02:46:31,439 --> 02:46:35,439
Json file as

3622
02:46:33,040 --> 02:46:37,800
well and again you would be working with

3623
02:46:35,439 --> 02:46:40,880
an actual

3624
02:46:37,800 --> 02:46:43,359
backend so that leaves us with the edit

3625
02:46:40,880 --> 02:46:46,160
now before we get to that I want even

3626
02:46:43,359 --> 02:46:50,200
though it redirected us I wanted to show

3627
02:46:46,160 --> 02:46:51,760
some proof that we deleted did the job

3628
02:46:50,200 --> 02:46:54,359
so we're going to use a package called

3629
02:46:51,760 --> 02:46:55,439
react toastify which will show a little

3630
02:46:54,359 --> 02:46:57,560
toast

3631
02:46:55,439 --> 02:47:01,240
notification uh wherever we want to put

3632
02:46:57,560 --> 02:47:03,359
it so let's install that I know this is

3633
02:47:01,240 --> 02:47:04,760
not you know this is a separate package

3634
02:47:03,359 --> 02:47:06,960
but it's something that you'll commonly

3635
02:47:04,760 --> 02:47:09,720
you'll probably commonly use I use it

3636
02:47:06,960 --> 02:47:11,960
all the time react icons react toasttify

3637
02:47:09,720 --> 02:47:15,279
react spinner these are things that I

3638
02:47:11,960 --> 02:47:17,479
use in just about every project so let's

3639
02:47:15,279 --> 02:47:19,130
say react

3640
02:47:17,479 --> 02:47:21,359
Dash toast

3641
02:47:19,130 --> 02:47:24,080
[Music]

3642
02:47:21,359 --> 02:47:25,880
ify now we have to set this up we need

3643
02:47:24,080 --> 02:47:29,279
to have

3644
02:47:25,880 --> 02:47:31,640
um let's see in our layout is where we

3645
02:47:29,279 --> 02:47:33,800
want to put this so that we're a so we

3646
02:47:31,640 --> 02:47:37,279
have a basically like a wrapper for the

3647
02:47:33,800 --> 02:47:41,319
layout to Output so if we go to our main

3648
02:47:37,279 --> 02:47:44,439
layout we're going to import from

3649
02:47:41,319 --> 02:47:46,640
here uh we're going to import the toast

3650
02:47:44,439 --> 02:47:49,120
container so

3651
02:47:46,640 --> 02:47:50,640
toast container that's that's going to

3652
02:47:49,120 --> 02:47:53,760
be from

3653
02:47:50,640 --> 02:47:57,439
react toasttify and then there's also a

3654
02:47:53,760 --> 02:48:01,000
CSS file that we need to import so

3655
02:47:57,439 --> 02:48:03,920
that's going to be react toasttify and

3656
02:48:01,000 --> 02:48:08,560
then slash dist

3657
02:48:03,920 --> 02:48:10,040
slash react toasttify docss like that

3658
02:48:08,560 --> 02:48:12,680
and then the container you can pretty

3659
02:48:10,040 --> 02:48:15,479
much put that anywhere it's positioned

3660
02:48:12,680 --> 02:48:17,560
absolute so it'll it should be up in the

3661
02:48:15,479 --> 02:48:20,000
corner um but you can change the

3662
02:48:17,560 --> 02:48:22,439
positioning with attributes or props if

3663
02:48:20,000 --> 02:48:26,399
you want but let's save

3664
02:48:22,439 --> 02:48:28,840
that now what we can do is when we

3665
02:48:26,399 --> 02:48:31,800
delete let's see where should we put

3666
02:48:28,840 --> 02:48:33,120
this we're going to put this in we could

3667
02:48:31,800 --> 02:48:35,840
do it

3668
02:48:33,120 --> 02:48:39,600
here but I think I'm going to put it in

3669
02:48:35,840 --> 02:48:41,240
the job page right before we redirect so

3670
02:48:39,600 --> 02:48:43,000
wherever you want to use a toast you

3671
02:48:41,240 --> 02:48:45,840
simply

3672
02:48:43,000 --> 02:48:49,359
import

3673
02:48:45,840 --> 02:48:52,240
toast uh from

3674
02:48:49,359 --> 02:48:54,040
react toasttify and then where we want

3675
02:48:52,240 --> 02:48:57,880
to call it let's go right after we

3676
02:48:54,040 --> 02:49:01,100
delete and say toast. success so you can

3677
02:48:57,880 --> 02:49:02,560
do success or error and let's say

3678
02:49:01,100 --> 02:49:04,520
[Music]

3679
02:49:02,560 --> 02:49:07,520
job

3680
02:49:04,520 --> 02:49:07,520
deleted

3681
02:49:07,720 --> 02:49:11,560
successfully all right so now let's try

3682
02:49:09,880 --> 02:49:12,920
it again I'm not going to delete any of

3683
02:49:11,560 --> 02:49:13,960
these I'm just going to create another

3684
02:49:12,920 --> 02:49:16,240
dummy

3685
02:49:13,960 --> 02:49:18,880
job actually before we do that let's do

3686
02:49:16,240 --> 02:49:23,239
a toast where we um where we added as as

3687
02:49:18,880 --> 02:49:26,239
well so we'll import this into the ad

3688
02:49:23,239 --> 02:49:28,479
page and then right before we redirect

3689
02:49:26,239 --> 02:49:30,640
here let's say

3690
02:49:28,479 --> 02:49:35,000
toast.

3691
02:49:30,640 --> 02:49:35,000
success and we'll say job

3692
02:49:35,040 --> 02:49:40,080
added

3693
02:49:37,960 --> 02:49:42,960
successfully okay so

3694
02:49:40,080 --> 02:49:45,520
now let's just put whatever just some

3695
02:49:42,960 --> 02:49:45,520
junk in

3696
02:49:47,640 --> 02:49:53,520
here

3697
02:49:50,239 --> 02:49:57,600
add there we go job added

3698
02:49:53,520 --> 02:49:57,600
successfully and then if I delete

3699
02:49:58,160 --> 02:50:03,920
it job deleted

3700
02:50:01,399 --> 02:50:06,279
successfully and you can do toast. error

3701
02:50:03,920 --> 02:50:09,200
if you want it to show an error for some

3702
02:50:06,279 --> 02:50:12,000
reason all right cool so now we're going

3703
02:50:09,200 --> 02:50:14,439
to do the the edit okay we have this

3704
02:50:12,000 --> 02:50:17,439
edit job button let's create the edit

3705
02:50:14,439 --> 02:50:20,880
job page we can close this stuff up

3706
02:50:17,439 --> 02:50:26,600
leave the app jsx open and in

3707
02:50:20,880 --> 02:50:26,600
Pages let's say edit job

3708
02:50:27,399 --> 02:50:33,120
page and then let's add the

3709
02:50:30,439 --> 02:50:37,479
route so in our

3710
02:50:33,120 --> 02:50:40,600
appjs it's import edit job

3711
02:50:37,479 --> 02:50:43,960
page and let's see we're going

3712
02:50:40,600 --> 02:50:43,960
to add

3713
02:50:45,000 --> 02:50:50,880
this um so with the edit page I'm

3714
02:50:49,080 --> 02:50:52,760
actually going to use the job loader

3715
02:50:50,880 --> 02:50:54,640
because in order to edit we have to

3716
02:50:52,760 --> 02:50:56,399
fetch the the data right and we already

3717
02:50:54,640 --> 02:50:58,680
have this job loader so we might as well

3718
02:50:56,399 --> 02:51:01,720
use that so I'm actually going to copy

3719
02:50:58,680 --> 02:51:05,040
this route for the job page copy that

3720
02:51:01,720 --> 02:51:07,000
down I'm going to change the route let's

3721
02:51:05,040 --> 02:51:11,720
do this one here we're going to change

3722
02:51:07,000 --> 02:51:16,800
it to edit Das job and then slash and

3723
02:51:11,720 --> 02:51:21,520
then the ID and change this to edit job

3724
02:51:16,800 --> 02:51:24,359
page and we can get of this delete

3725
02:51:21,520 --> 02:51:25,720
job and just like we did with the job

3726
02:51:24,359 --> 02:51:28,040
page we're going to pass in the job

3727
02:51:25,720 --> 02:51:32,040
loader that'll give us access to the

3728
02:51:28,040 --> 02:51:37,120
data so let's save that now if we click

3729
02:51:32,040 --> 02:51:40,319
on the edit button it should take us um

3730
02:51:37,120 --> 02:51:43,279
wait a minute that goes to job

3731
02:51:40,319 --> 02:51:46,840
sledit I'm actually going to change that

3732
02:51:43,279 --> 02:51:49,359
so in the job page where we have the

3733
02:51:46,840 --> 02:51:52,000
edit button

3734
02:51:49,359 --> 02:51:55,800
I'm going to change

3735
02:51:52,000 --> 02:51:58,600
that to edit Das

3736
02:51:55,800 --> 02:52:01,080
job and then the

3737
02:51:58,600 --> 02:52:03,720
ID so edit there we go so now we're

3738
02:52:01,080 --> 02:52:05,439
seeing the page and since we passed that

3739
02:52:03,720 --> 02:52:07,880
loader and we can do the same thing that

3740
02:52:05,439 --> 02:52:11,680
we did in the job page we can bring in

3741
02:52:07,880 --> 02:52:13,760
use loader data and then simply do this

3742
02:52:11,680 --> 02:52:17,239
and we should have access to the job for

3743
02:52:13,760 --> 02:52:17,239
that page so I'm going to grab

3744
02:52:17,520 --> 02:52:22,640
that

3745
02:52:20,359 --> 02:52:26,439
and let's

3746
02:52:22,640 --> 02:52:28,960
see do we need this stuff here

3747
02:52:26,439 --> 02:52:35,920
um yeah we'll just leave it for now and

3748
02:52:28,960 --> 02:52:39,600
then let's do this so use loader

3749
02:52:35,920 --> 02:52:41,760
data and go like that and then I'm just

3750
02:52:39,600 --> 02:52:45,640
going to do actually what what I'll do

3751
02:52:41,760 --> 02:52:49,359
is output here and we should be able to

3752
02:52:45,640 --> 02:52:51,279
get the job. tile so let's go back and

3753
02:52:49,359 --> 02:52:53,439
there we go so we're we're getting the

3754
02:52:51,279 --> 02:52:56,239
data for whatever job we're trying to

3755
02:52:53,439 --> 02:52:59,840
edit so reactjs developer click on edit

3756
02:52:56,239 --> 02:53:02,720
job reactjs developer so I think the the

3757
02:52:59,840 --> 02:53:06,279
data loader feature in react router is

3758
02:53:02,720 --> 02:53:08,200
really cool for stuff like this now we

3759
02:53:06,279 --> 02:53:10,760
need the form and we need to fill the

3760
02:53:08,200 --> 02:53:17,359
form with existing data so why don't we

3761
02:53:10,760 --> 02:53:21,479
copy the entire add form so add job page

3762
02:53:17,359 --> 02:53:21,479
let's grab the entire

3763
02:53:23,279 --> 02:53:28,239
section okay so we're going to grab that

3764
02:53:25,520 --> 02:53:32,120
and then go to the edit job page and

3765
02:53:28,239 --> 02:53:33,279
then let's return in parentheses paste

3766
02:53:32,120 --> 02:53:35,680
that

3767
02:53:33,279 --> 02:53:39,319
in and we're going to do the same thing

3768
02:53:35,680 --> 02:53:43,720
where we have the state so we can also

3769
02:53:39,319 --> 02:53:44,840
copy this all this stuff right here and

3770
02:53:43,720 --> 02:53:48,720
put that

3771
02:53:44,840 --> 02:53:51,600
in put that right here actually let's

3772
02:53:48,720 --> 02:53:55,960
let's put the state above

3773
02:53:51,600 --> 02:53:58,200
that all right and then what we can do

3774
02:53:55,960 --> 02:54:00,399
is put the default actually no we want

3775
02:53:58,200 --> 02:54:03,399
this above the state because I want to

3776
02:54:00,399 --> 02:54:07,040
add the defaults from this job so for

3777
02:54:03,399 --> 02:54:10,200
instance the title let's say job.

3778
02:54:07,040 --> 02:54:12,680
tile so for the

3779
02:54:10,200 --> 02:54:16,359
type let's say

3780
02:54:12,680 --> 02:54:18,600
job. type and this will F this will add

3781
02:54:16,359 --> 02:54:20,960
the fields in the form add the data in

3782
02:54:18,600 --> 02:54:23,960
the form so

3783
02:54:20,960 --> 02:54:23,960
job.

3784
02:54:24,279 --> 02:54:30,000

3800
02:55:23,200 --> 02:55:29,720
dot contact phone all right so if I save

3801
02:55:27,040 --> 02:55:33,479
that we get use state is not defined so

3802
02:55:29,720 --> 02:55:33,479
we do have to bring in use

3803
02:55:38,319 --> 02:55:44,680
State submit form is not defined so the

3804
02:55:41,520 --> 02:55:46,880
form has this on it this submit form

3805
02:55:44,680 --> 02:55:50,239
function so we just need to create that

3806
02:55:46,880 --> 02:55:50,239
say submit

3807
02:55:52,680 --> 02:55:56,880
form I don't have to put anything in it

3808
02:55:54,800 --> 02:55:58,479
just yet just create the function and

3809
02:55:56,880 --> 02:56:01,600
now you can see the form is actually

3810
02:55:58,479 --> 02:56:05,840
populated with the right

3811
02:56:01,600 --> 02:56:07,160
data which is exactly what we want now

3812
02:56:05,840 --> 02:56:09,680
the submit

3813
02:56:07,160 --> 02:56:11,359
form we might as well copy it from the

3814
02:56:09,680 --> 02:56:13,200
ad because we're going to do the same

3815
02:56:11,359 --> 02:56:16,080
thing and construct the new job so let's

3816
02:56:13,200 --> 02:56:17,239
just grab uh yeah we'll just grab this

3817
02:56:16,080 --> 02:56:20,239
whole

3818
02:56:17,239 --> 02:56:20,239
thing

3819
02:56:20,279 --> 02:56:25,840
and then in the edit submit form paste

3820
02:56:23,319 --> 02:56:26,840
that in now one difference here is going

3821
02:56:25,840 --> 02:56:32,000
to

3822
02:56:26,840 --> 02:56:33,279
be uh we're going to pass along the ID

3823
02:56:32,000 --> 02:56:35,000
because we're going to need it when we

3824
02:56:33,279 --> 02:56:39,000
make the request so I'm just going to

3825
02:56:35,000 --> 02:56:40,800
pass in ID right here and then instead

3826
02:56:39,000 --> 02:56:41,880
of actually instead of new job let's

3827
02:56:40,800 --> 02:56:46,000
call

3828
02:56:41,880 --> 02:56:50,040
this updated job and then instead of add

3829
02:56:46,000 --> 02:56:53,479
job submit let's say

3830
02:56:50,040 --> 02:56:55,960
update job submit and pass

3831
02:56:53,479 --> 02:56:59,560
in updated

3832
02:56:55,960 --> 02:57:02,760
job and then we'll do a toast we'll say

3833
02:56:59,560 --> 02:57:04,840
job updated successfully but we do have

3834
02:57:02,760 --> 02:57:08,800
to bring in toast because I don't think

3835
02:57:04,840 --> 02:57:11,800
yeah we didn't bring it in so

3836
02:57:08,800 --> 02:57:11,800
import

3837
02:57:15,439 --> 02:57:19,720
toast

3838
02:57:17,160 --> 02:57:22,880
okay now

3839
02:57:19,720 --> 02:57:26,200
this this um actually let's also

3840
02:57:22,880 --> 02:57:29,640
redirect to the job page so let's put in

3841
02:57:26,200 --> 02:57:32,279
some back ticks here and we'll say job

3842
02:57:29,640 --> 02:57:37,160
job slash and

3843
02:57:32,279 --> 02:57:41,000
then the uh yeah we just put the

3844
02:57:37,160 --> 02:57:44,080
ID now this right here update job submit

3845
02:57:41,000 --> 02:57:46,319
we're going to pass in as a prop so

3846
02:57:44,080 --> 02:57:49,000
update job

3847
02:57:46,319 --> 02:57:51,479
submit um also if we're we're going to

3848
02:57:49,000 --> 02:57:54,239
navigate we're using navigate here that

3849
02:57:51,479 --> 02:57:54,239
means we have to

3850
02:57:58,200 --> 02:58:03,560
initialize use

3851
02:58:01,040 --> 02:58:07,000
navigate um and yeah I don't think we

3852
02:58:03,560 --> 02:58:07,000
need we don't need used

3853
02:58:07,479 --> 02:58:14,040
pams so that should be

3854
02:58:10,600 --> 02:58:16,960
good all right now this update job

3855
02:58:14,040 --> 02:58:19,040
submit let's go back to our appjs

3856
02:58:16,960 --> 02:58:22,200
because we need to basically catch that

3857
02:58:19,040 --> 02:58:25,680
and then fire off a function in here so

3858
02:58:22,200 --> 02:58:27,399
where we have our edit job page let's

3859
02:58:25,680 --> 02:58:32,399
do uh

3860
02:58:27,399 --> 02:58:32,399
update job submit and we'll set that

3861
02:58:33,200 --> 02:58:40,640
to a function called update job and then

3862
02:58:37,359 --> 02:58:40,640
up here we'll create

3863
02:58:41,520 --> 02:58:47,040
that so const

3864
02:58:45,319 --> 02:58:50,040
update

3865
02:58:47,040 --> 02:58:50,040
job

3866
02:58:51,880 --> 02:58:57,160
all right now as far as what we're going

3867
02:58:53,439 --> 02:58:58,520
to do here I'm just going to copy this

3868
02:58:57,160 --> 02:59:01,000
from the

3869
02:58:58,520 --> 02:59:02,720
ad and you could put these requests in a

3870
02:59:01,000 --> 02:59:05,279
separate file if you want in some kind

3871
02:59:02,720 --> 02:59:07,200
of service but I'm just I'm trying to

3872
02:59:05,279 --> 02:59:09,520
keep things

3873
02:59:07,200 --> 02:59:11,279
simple uh let's see so this is going to

3874
02:59:09,520 --> 02:59:15,479
be Fetch and

3875
02:59:11,279 --> 02:59:18,279
then um the job will come in

3876
02:59:15,479 --> 02:59:22,120
here and then we'll change these the

3877
02:59:18,279 --> 02:59:25,680
back TI because it's going to be jobs

3878
02:59:22,120 --> 02:59:28,640
slash and then job. so that's why I

3879
02:59:25,680 --> 02:59:31,040
added the ID in the other file it's

3880
02:59:28,640 --> 02:59:34,960
going to be a put

3881
02:59:31,040 --> 02:59:38,560
request and let's see the body here is

3882
02:59:34,960 --> 02:59:38,560
going to be

3883
02:59:38,640 --> 02:59:43,120
job actually we could call this no

3884
02:59:41,720 --> 02:59:46,640
that's

3885
02:59:43,120 --> 02:59:49,880
fine yeah and then that should do it

3886
02:59:46,640 --> 02:59:53,520
let's save that and let's try it

3887
02:59:49,880 --> 02:59:56,640
out so we have our reactjs developer job

3888
02:59:53,520 --> 02:59:59,040
let's change it to just reactjs

3889
02:59:56,640 --> 03:00:01,800
Dev and we'll keep all the rest of the

3890
02:59:59,040 --> 03:00:01,800
stuff add

3891
03:00:02,399 --> 03:00:06,200
job uh it's not

3892
03:00:13,560 --> 03:00:18,600
submitting reference ID is not

3893
03:00:16,960 --> 03:00:22,200
defined

3894
03:00:18,600 --> 03:00:26,600
oh ID is not defined

3895
03:00:22,200 --> 03:00:28,359
um so this so I guess yeah I guess we do

3896
03:00:26,600 --> 03:00:31,560
need the use pams because we got to get

3897
03:00:28,359 --> 03:00:34,680
the ID so from react router Dawn Dom

3898
03:00:31,560 --> 03:00:34,680
let's say use

3899
03:00:36,520 --> 03:00:42,720
pams

3900
03:00:39,200 --> 03:00:44,720
and we can just go right here

3901
03:00:42,720 --> 03:00:46,920
con

3902
03:00:44,720 --> 03:00:49,479
ID use

3903
03:00:46,920 --> 03:00:52,399
pams

3904
03:00:49,479 --> 03:00:56,640
okay we'll try

3905
03:00:52,399 --> 03:00:56,640
that change that to react

3906
03:00:57,840 --> 03:01:02,399
Dev we'll change the text to this too

3907
03:01:00,560 --> 03:01:04,760
but let's submit job updated

3908
03:01:02,399 --> 03:01:08,120
successfully and it changed to reactjs

3909
03:01:04,760 --> 03:01:11,479
Dev and it redirects us to the page

3910
03:01:08,120 --> 03:01:11,479
let's just change the button

3911
03:01:12,680 --> 03:01:19,920
text so right here change that to update

3912
03:01:17,399 --> 03:01:19,920
job

3913
03:01:20,239 --> 03:01:26,359
is there a heading too yeah we change

3914
03:01:22,800 --> 03:01:30,359
the heading because it says add

3915
03:01:26,359 --> 03:01:33,720
job so right here

3916
03:01:30,359 --> 03:01:35,600
update all right so we we have a full

3917
03:01:33,720 --> 03:01:37,680
crud

3918
03:01:35,600 --> 03:01:39,960
application the only thing we're missing

3919
03:01:37,680 --> 03:01:42,479
is authentication but like I said that's

3920
03:01:39,960 --> 03:01:44,920
that's beyond this tutorial this this

3921
03:01:42,479 --> 03:01:48,040
went way longer than I initially planned

3922
03:01:44,920 --> 03:01:51,359
and wanted but we did a lot you know we

3923
03:01:48,040 --> 03:01:56,319
we learned about components props State

3924
03:01:51,359 --> 03:01:59,640
the react router um uh data loaders use

3925
03:01:56,319 --> 03:02:02,479
effect use State use pams all those

3926
03:01:59,640 --> 03:02:05,600
hooks with react router Dom so I think

3927
03:02:02,479 --> 03:02:07,640
we we touched on a lot and I think that

3928
03:02:05,600 --> 03:02:11,080
you should have enough to create some

3929
03:02:07,640 --> 03:02:13,800
some simple projects on your own now as

3930
03:02:11,080 --> 03:02:16,920
far as deploying what you would do is

3931
03:02:13,800 --> 03:02:18,359
just run npm run build and that will

3932
03:02:16,920 --> 03:02:20,520
give you

3933
03:02:18,359 --> 03:02:22,040
uh that will give you a production

3934
03:02:20,520 --> 03:02:24,279
version of your site you see how the

3935
03:02:22,040 --> 03:02:25,960
react Dev tools right here it's orange

3936
03:02:24,279 --> 03:02:28,160
and it says this page is using the

3937
03:02:25,960 --> 03:02:30,840
development build of react because we're

3938
03:02:28,160 --> 03:02:33,439
running the development server so what I

3939
03:02:30,840 --> 03:02:37,640
can do is stop the development

3940
03:02:33,439 --> 03:02:40,520
server and I can do npm run

3941
03:02:37,640 --> 03:02:43,880
build what that'll do is create a new

3942
03:02:40,520 --> 03:02:45,200
folder called disc and that disc is your

3943
03:02:43,880 --> 03:02:50,040
production

3944
03:02:45,200 --> 03:02:53,080
build okay so I can run that with v

3945
03:02:50,040 --> 03:02:55,600
there's a in the package.json there's a

3946
03:02:53,080 --> 03:02:57,439
preview right this preview and that

3947
03:02:55,600 --> 03:02:59,359
should run the development build so

3948
03:02:57,439 --> 03:03:02,359
let's say npm

3949
03:02:59,359 --> 03:03:02,359
run

3950
03:03:02,560 --> 03:03:08,319
preview and that's running on

3951
03:03:05,000 --> 03:03:11,040
4173 so now notice this extension says

3952
03:03:08,319 --> 03:03:12,200
this page is using the production build

3953
03:03:11,040 --> 03:03:15,319
of

3954
03:03:12,200 --> 03:03:17,760
react okay so now this is this is what

3955
03:03:15,319 --> 03:03:19,080
you would deploy this disc folder and

3956
03:03:17,760 --> 03:03:22,080
and you could basically deploy it

3957
03:03:19,080 --> 03:03:24,040
anywhere now if you do try to deploy

3958
03:03:22,080 --> 03:03:26,640
this it's not going to show the jobs

3959
03:03:24,040 --> 03:03:30,120
because we're using a local server we're

3960
03:03:26,640 --> 03:03:31,760
using Jason server if you actually want

3961
03:03:30,120 --> 03:03:33,920
this to be a real project then you're

3962
03:03:31,760 --> 03:03:36,479
going to have to create an API with

3963
03:03:33,920 --> 03:03:37,840
Express or something else um but you're

3964
03:03:36,479 --> 03:03:41,600
not going to really have to change

3965
03:03:37,840 --> 03:03:43,279
anything as far as this stuff because

3966
03:03:41,600 --> 03:03:45,800
this is going to be the same whether

3967
03:03:43,279 --> 03:03:48,399
we're dealing with Jason server or

3968
03:03:45,800 --> 03:03:53,359
you're dealing with a a rest API I with

3969
03:03:48,399 --> 03:03:56,160
Express D Jango laravel just whatever um

3970
03:03:53,359 --> 03:03:59,600
so yeah I mean this is this is a a

3971
03:03:56,160 --> 03:04:02,600
front-end course but I did want to give

3972
03:03:59,600 --> 03:04:04,399
you some examples of using backend data

3973
03:04:02,600 --> 03:04:06,760
because that's what it's what you do in

3974
03:04:04,399 --> 03:04:08,120
the real world all right guys so

3975
03:04:06,760 --> 03:04:10,920
hopefully you enjoyed this I hope you

3976
03:04:08,120 --> 03:04:12,680
learned something from it um like I said

3977
03:04:10,920 --> 03:04:16,399
there's so many different ways and react

3978
03:04:12,680 --> 03:04:18,040
to do everything so if you saw some

3979
03:04:16,399 --> 03:04:20,880
things the way that I did you didn't

3980
03:04:18,040 --> 03:04:23,000
like it that's fine you know everybody

3981
03:04:20,880 --> 03:04:25,080
has their own way of doing things uh and

3982
03:04:23,000 --> 03:04:27,520
also keep in mind I try to do things as

3983
03:04:25,080 --> 03:04:29,920
in the simplest way possible so that I

3984
03:04:27,520 --> 03:04:32,720
can explain it and people can can learn

3985
03:04:29,920 --> 03:04:34,520
it and understand but that's it guys

3986
03:04:32,720 --> 03:04:37,760
thank you so much for watching and I

3987
03:04:34,520 --> 03:04:37,760
will see you next time
