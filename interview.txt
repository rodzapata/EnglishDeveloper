My name is Rodney, and Iâ€™m from Colombia. Iâ€™m a web developer with experience building backend applications using Java and Spring Boot. I enjoy creating efficient and well-structured systems, and Iâ€™m always looking to learn new technologies.

What are your strengths as a developer?
R:/
ðŸ’¡ 1. Rapid Learning & Adaptability
I can quickly understand new frameworks, languages, and architectures by pulling from vast technical documentation and real-world examples. Whether itâ€™s NestJS, Spring Boot, or .NET 8, I can help implement features fast.

ðŸ§  2. Problem Solving
I excel at breaking down complex problems into smaller parts, analyzing stack traces, debugging code, and suggesting clean, optimized solutionsâ€”whether it's fixing a recursive bug, optimizing SQL queries, or resolving REST API integration issues.

ðŸ“¦ 3. Full-Stack Support
From database design and backend logic to frontend UI/UX and deployment pipelines, I can provide guidance or code in:

Backend: Node.js, Java (Spring Boot), .NET (C#), Python (FastAPI)

Frontend: React, Angular, HTML/CSS/JS, Next.js

DevOps: Docker, GitHub Actions, CI/CD pipelines

ðŸ”’ 4. Code Quality & Best Practices
I emphasize SOLID principles, clean architecture (layered, hexagonal, DDD), secure coding (JWT, input validation, password hashing), and writing reusable, testable components. I can even help you implement unit and integration tests.

ðŸ“š 5. Communication & Documentation
I can generate clear documentation, diagrams (like ERDs or flowcharts), README files, or even software requirement specs. Thatâ€™s a big plus in agile teams or when onboarding new developers.

ðŸ§ª 6. Testing & Refactoring
I advocate for Test-Driven Development (TDD) and can help with writing test cases using tools like JUnit, Jest, xUnit, etc. I also suggest when and how to refactor legacy code safely.
