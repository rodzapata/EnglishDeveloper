advanced JavaScript objects

In JavaScript, most things are objects, from core Javascrip feautures like arrays to the 
browser APIS build on top of JavaScript. You cal also créate your own ojects to encapsulate
related functions and variables into efficient packages and act as Handy data containers.

having a deeper khowledge of how Javascrip objects work is useful as you build confidence with
web development, start to build more complex apps, and créate your own libraries. This module
Will help you by providing JavaScript object theory and object-oriented programming practice.

Prerequsites

Before starting this module, you should really have lernt the fundamentals of JavaScript, 
especially JavaScript object basic. It would also be helpfull to have some familiarity with
HTML and CSS.

OOJS1
In this task we provide you with the start of a definition for a Shape class.
It has three properties: name, sides, and sideLength. This class only models
shapes for which all sides are the same length, like a square o an equillateral triangle.

To complete the task:
1. Add a constructor to this class. The constructor takes arguments for the name, sides, and
   sideLength properties, and initializes them.
2. Add a new method calcPerimeter() method to the class, which calculates its perimeter(the
   length of the shape's outer edge) and logs the results to the console.
3. Create a new instance of the Shape class called square. Give it a name of square, 4 sides,
   and a sideLength of 5.
4. Call your calcPerimeter() method on the instance, to see whether it logs the calculation
   result to the browser's console as expected.
5. Create a new instance of shape called triangle, with name of triangle, 3 sides and a
   sideLength of 3.
6. Call trinagle.calcPerimeter() to check that it works OK.
