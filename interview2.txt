I am a software developer with experience in JavaScript and React.
I have worked with Promises, async and await, pure functions, and functional programming concepts.

My preferred architecture is component-based architecture, because it is modular, reusable, and easier to maintain.

I have experience writing unit tests with tools like Jest.
Testing helps me ensure code quality and avoid regressions.

I use Git for version control, creating branches, pull requests, and handling merges in a team environment.

“I use React Context API for state management, and Next.js for server-side rendering and building scalable web applications.”
