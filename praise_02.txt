10,000 Reasons (Bless the Lord)
Canción de Matt Redman ‧ 2013

Bless the lord oh my soul
oh my soul
worship his holy name
sing like never before
oh my soul
I'll worship your holy name

The sun comes up
it's a new day dawning
it's time to sing your song again
whatever may pass
and whatever lies before me
let me be singing
when the evening comes

Bless the lord oh my soul
oh my soul
worship his holy name
sing like never before
oh my soul
I'll worship your holy name

you're rich in love
and you're slow to anger
your name is great
and your heart is kind
for all your goodness
I Will keep on singing
ten thousand reasons
for my heart to find

so bless the Lord mh my soul
oh may soul
worship his holy name
sing like never before
oh my soul
I'll worship your holy name
Bless you Lord

and on that day
when my stregth is falling
the end draws near
and my time has come
still my soul Will
sing your praise unending
ten thousand years
and then forevermore
forevermore

Bless the Lord oh my soul
oh my soul
worship his holy name
sing like never before
oh my soul
I'll worship your holy name

Bless the Lord oh my soul
oh my soul
worship his loly name
sing like never before
oh my soul
I'll worship your holy name
yes I'll worship your holy name
Lord I'll worship your holy name

sing like never before
oh my soul
