God is good
All the time
He put a song of praise
In this heart of mine

God is good
All the time
Trough the darkest night
His light will shine

God Is Good
God is Good
All the time

(Chorus)
God is good
All the time
He put a song of praise
In this heart of mine

God is good
All the time
Trough the darkest night
His light will shine

God is Good
God is Good
All the time

If you're walking trough the valley
There are shadows all around
Do not fear, he will guide you
He will keep tou safe and sound
He has promised to never leave you
Nor forsake you
And his word is true

(Chorus)
God is good
All the time
He put a song of praise
In this heart of mine

God is good
All the time
Trough the darkest night
His light will shine

God is Good
God is Good
All the time

We were senners and so unworthy
Still for us he chose to die
He filled us with his holy spirit
Now we can stand and testify
That his love is everlasting
And his mercies they will never end

(Chorus)
God is good
All the time
He put a song of praise
In this heart of mine

God is good
All the time
Trough the darkest night
His light will shine

God is Good
God is Good
All the time

Though I may not understand
All the plans you have for me
My life is in your hands
And trough the eyes of faith I can clearly see

(Chorus)
God is good
All the time
He put a song of praise
In this heart of mine

God is good
All the time
Trough the darkest night
His light will shine

God is Good
God is Good
God is Good
It's good
All the time
