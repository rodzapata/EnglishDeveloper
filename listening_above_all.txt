your are crucified 
laid behind the stone
you lived to die
rejected and alone
like a rose, trampled on the ground

you took the found, throung of me
I above all 
I above all power
I above all kind it
I above all neichor
and do craysed

I above all west and do
hi ments

I above all kind 
begind

I above all wonder

There is none like you
no hay 
end find
eternad

you mercy flow lai

safori to main
every none like you
