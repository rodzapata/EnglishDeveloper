Authentication is an essential part of most applications. There are many different approaches and strategies to handle authentication. The approach taken for any project depends on its particular application requirements. This chapter presents several approaches to authentication that can be adapted to a variety of different requirements.

Let's flesh out our requirements. For this use case, clients will start by authenticating with a username and password. Once authenticated, the server will issue a JWT that can be sent as a bearer token in an authorization header on subsequent requests to prove authentication. We'll also create a protected route that is accessible only to requests that contain a valid JWT.

We'll start with the first requirement: authenticating a user. We'll then extend that by issuing a JWT. Finally, we'll create a protected route that checks for a valid JWT on the request.
