Goodness of God:
Bethel music y Jenn Johnson 2019

I love you, Lord
For Your mercy never fails me
all my days, I've been held in your hands
from the momento that I wake up
until I lay my head
Oh, I Will sing of the goodness of God

and all my life you have been faithful
and all my life you have been so, so Good
with every breath that I am able
oh, I Will sing of the goodness of God

I love your voice
you have led me through the fire
in the darkest night
you are close like no other
I've known you as a Father
I've known you as a Friend
and I have lived in the goodness of God (yeah)

and all my life you have been faithful (oh)
and all my life you have been so, so Good
with every breath that I am able
Oh, I Will sing of the goodness of God (yeah)

'Cause your goodness is running after, it's running after me
your goodness is running after, it's running after me
with my life laid down, I'm surrendered now
I give you everything
'Cause your goodness is running afer, it's running after me (oh)

your goodness is running after, it's running after me
your goodness is running after, it's running after me
with my life laid down, I'm surrendered now
I give you everything
'Cause your goodness is running after
it keeps running after me

and all my life you have been faithful
and all my life you have been so, so Good
with every breath that I am able
Oh, I'm gonna sing of the goodness of God
I'm gonna sing, I'm gonna sing

'Cause all my life you have been faithful
and all my life you have been so, so Good
with every breath that I am able
Oh, I'm gonna sing of the goodness of God
oh, I'm gonna sing ot the goodness of God

we love your praise
all for all my days
